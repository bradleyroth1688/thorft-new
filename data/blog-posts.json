    "content": "<p>Raymond Micaletti built the MOOD ETF around a single idea: institutions consistently outperform retail traders, and you can measure the difference. After watching a relative sentiment indicator correctly call two major market bottoms while all his other signals failed, he stopped ignoring it and started building.In this episode, Ray breaks down how he uses Commitments of Traders data and sentiment surveys to construct signals across equities, bonds, commodities, and currencies. We dig into the structural advantages institutions have over retail, why his approach avoids the whipsaw problem that kills most adaptive strategies, and where it can still get you in trouble. He also makes a strong case for pairing relative sentiment with trend following\u2014two strategies that naturally offset each other's weaknesses.Website: www.relativesentiment.com ETF site: relativesentimentetfs.com Twitter: @relsenttech</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Raymond Micaletti covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>The podcast where we go beyond the symbol and into the strategy. I'm Brad Roth, founder and chief investment officer at Thor Funds, and in each episode\nI sit down with ETF managers, CIOs, and industry leaders to break down how these funds\nare actually built, how they behave in real markets, and how advisors use them in real\nportfolios. Those people just see a ticker symbol, but we know much more goes on behind the ticker. Hey, Ray, welcome to the show.</p>\n<p>So\nno need to make that trade. So everything you do from an allocation standpoint and\nwaiting standpoint or rebalance standpoint, I mean, you got a checklist of rules, or is there any\nart that finesse that you guys are putting into the portfolio, or you just strictly created a\nchecklist of rules, which you're going to follow, and it's a fully ruled it rules-based process. So when we started it, it was fully rules-based. And we had the equity side of the portfolio,\nwas entirely rules-based, and I had non-row to sentiment strategies, as I mentioned, when I launched\nfrom the non-equity portion, and those were rules-based as well.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>And just, I should have probably asked this earlier. You're investing across\nalways different asset classes. How are you actually making those getting that exposure? Is it\na fun to fund funds or how, like, what does the holdings look like if someone were to, you know,\ngo to the website and take a look at your holding space, like, what's in it? It is a fun to\nETFs. So we tried to use the the most liquid lowest cost ETFs to represent the various exposures.</p>\n<p>And in that case, it was like long duration bonds and other things where\nhow they're positioned in equities complimented by how they're positioned in long duration bonds\nor along the yield curve was what would actually give you more predicted for her. And that's\npretty much what I do. One of my models looked at how investors are positioned directly in\nequities. So the S&P, the NASDAQ, the Russell 2000, aggregate data information, but also added to\nthat how they're positioned in long duration bonds.</p>\n<p>So for currently 50%\nequities in the target is 56 this week, I'll leave it at 50. If it goes down to 42, I'm going to\nleave it at 50. If it goes up to 65, won't it go into movement? Because 65 is outside that 10 percentage\npoint range. Just to keep turn over and check and also, if it's anything less than 10 percentage\npoints on the equity side, it doesn't necessarily move the needle over short time horizon.</p>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in fixed income relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in quantitative investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in income investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Raymond Micaletti highlights important considerations around fixed income.

    "content": "<p>Sam Rahman and John McNamara joined Brad to discuss the launch and philosophy behind the HGRO ETF. Hedgeye, originally built on delivering institutional-quality macroeconomic research to a broader audience, has now extended into the asset management space with active ETF offerings.</p>\n<h2>About Sam Rahman & John McNamara and Hedgeye Asset Managment</h2>\n<p>Sam, who previously managed public equity investments for the Fidelity family office, explained how HGRO fills a gap in the ETF landscape: it offers a concentrated, actively managed large-cap growth portfolio that emphasizes risk-adjusted returns. He emphasized that most large-cap growth ETFs are either over-diversified and benchmark-hugging or overly concentrated and thematic, leaving little in between. HGRO aims to provide thoughtful portfolio construction and institutional-quality research to everyday investors.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>The strategy focuses on three core themes: deep moat compounders, innovators and disruptors, and special situations. Sam described the selection process as conviction-driven but bounded by disciplined portfolio risk constraints, with max 3% active weights on both stock and sector levels. Sell decisions are typically driven by fundamental deterioration or technical breakdowns.</p>\n<p>John shared that HGRO is intended to be a core large-cap equity position in diversified portfolios and is gaining early traction among large RIAs. He also confirmed that Hedgeye has more ETF launches in the pipeline and plans to build on its highly engaged research community and media platform to drive continued growth.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Sam Rahman & John McNamara covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>Today we have on Sam Ramen and John McNamara. They're from HGIS at Management and we are talking about their newly issued ETF, the HGI Quality Growth ETF, ticker,\nHGRO. It's really a concentrated large cap portfolio. They're looking at risk adjusted returns. Most large cap growth ETFs are either over-deversified or two benchmark hugging. This focuses on three core themes, which is kind of those deep-mote compounders innovators as well as some special situations.</p>\n<p>So, I've been in the industry for over 30 years now. Of that 25 years, actually, managing portfolios. So, over those 30 years, I've only been at two firms. The first firm was a British investment firm called bearing asset management,\nwhich is part of the old bearings bag. A very backpack, maybe knows her history. But it goes back like almost a couple of centuries back to the Napoleonic Wars. When they were like funding trading for the British Empire,\nand it was the queues back for many, many years.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So, it was a pretty blue blooded place when I joined there in 1993. But for that 15 years, I was there. I got a great education,\nbecause I spent my first year or two with the Chief Investment Officer there. So, he was in charge of all global investments and not just equities,\nbut bonds, half-ax commodities and emerging markets. So, sitting next to him and listening to how he was talking to other portfolio managers across different regions,\nit was a great way to learn about the global markets, macro investing,\nhow all these pieces fit together, how bonds and equities and currencies work.</p>\n<p>And if Tesla works as great,\nit's going to be the driving force of the performance\nof that fund. But if it doesn't work,\nthen everything else is irrelevant\nbecause that one stock is dictating. So, I never want to be beholden to one stock\nno matter how much I liked or how good I thought\nI understood the business. So, I kind of had these own built-in risk parameters,\nboth on the stock levels,\nplus or minus 3%. But also the sector level,\nplus or minus 3%.</p>\n<p>So, that was fantastic for me. But always know, I knew I want to be like a stock investor. So, as I was writing research for the global investment strategy team,\nit caught the eye on the then-head of the U.S.</p>\n<p>But also,\nthey keep deepening at one time. So, as they generate three cash flow\nthat they're compounding every year,\nthey're not just always just giving it back to shareholders\nand reinvesting it back. It's the business to deepen those modes\nto strengthen those superb advantages,\nso that I'm also investing in innovative areas\nthat keep extending their reach in their mode. I mean, I'll be honest with you. It's kind of an obvious category. But if you look at everybody's growth portfolio in large-cap,\nthey own their own design.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"So, if you look at the large cap growth\nequity universe,\nnow in the ETF space you have\nthe really, really big players\nthat have ETFs that I don't have,\nlike 75, 100, 100,\nplus stocks in them.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"You know,\nthat's the key thing,\nit's the basically be able to,\nto be in all weather pool fully,\nand it also's a market,\nand that diversification gives us the opportunity,\nalso to find good ideas,\nwhere people on this field I was looking.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Sam, who previously managed public equity investments for the Fidelity family office, explained how HGRO fills a gap in the ETF landscape: it offers a concentrated, actively managed large-cap growth portfolio that emphasizes risk-adjusted returns.</li>\n<li>HGRO aims to provide thoughtful portfolio construction and institutional-quality research to everyday investors.</li>\n<li>The strategy focuses on three core themes: deep moat compounders, innovators and disruptors, and special situations.</li>\n<li>Sell decisions are typically driven by fundamental deterioration or technical breakdowns.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Sam Rahman & John McNamara highlights important considerations around portfolio construction.

    "content": "<p>In this episode of Behind the Ticker, Brad Roth speaks with Seth Cogswell, Portfolio Manager at Running Oak Capital, about the firm\u2019s flagship ETF\u2014RUNN, the Running Oak Efficient Growth ETF. With a background that spans fundamental equity research and derivatives trading, Cogswell shares his journey to Running Oak and how the firm\u2019s roots in separately managed accounts (SMAs) laid the foundation for its ETF strategy. Originally launched in 2009 for advisors seeking a smoother ride through market cycles, the strategy behind RUNN has delivered strong results with an emphasis on downside protection.</p>\n<h2>About Seth Cogswell and Running Oak</h2>\n<p>Cogswell breaks down how RUNN combines a core equity portfolio of 30\u201350 high-conviction U.S. large-cap stocks with a adaptive allocation to fixed income and cash equivalents. What sets RUNN apart is its ability to dynamically shift its allocation between risk-on and risk-off environments. The fund can reduce equity exposure as low as 30% or raise it up to 90%, based on a rules-based framework that evaluates macro indicators, valuation metrics, and market trends. This allows the fund to dial down risk during market stress and re-enter more aggressively during recovery phases.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>The equity sleeve of the portfolio focuses on quality companies with strong free cash flow and sustainable growth\u2014avoiding overvalued, speculative names. Meanwhile, the fixed income sleeve remains flexible, emphasizing high credit quality and shorter durations when risk is elevated. Cogswell notes that RUNN is actively managed daily, with oversight to ensure discipline in both the equity and fixed income allocations. The team also maintains a consistent philosophy that prioritizes risk-adjusted returns and long-term capital appreciation rather than chasing short-term performance.</p>\n<p>Designed for use as a core equity holding or a risk-managed growth strategy, RUNN offers advisors and investors an efficient, transparent vehicle to navigate unpredictable markets. With a track record rooted in the firm\u2019s SMA history and now offered in a more tax-efficient ETF format, the fund aims to deliver smoother performance without sacrificing long-term upside.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Seth Cogswell covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>If you're taking a concentrated approach,\nmaybe you do a very deep fundamental dive on a company and you decide this is a great investment. You do that for some other companies and now you've got a portfolio of high conviction names. We have a totally different approach. We have, particularly me, I have absolute conviction\nthat if we maintain a portfolio with higher and ex-growth, attractive valuations,\nlower downside risk, that we will, over the long run, provide higher return, lower risk.</p>\n<p>The more you flip it though, the more likely it approaches 50%. So, 50% have 50% tails. We look at each company as a coin flip. Each company gives us an opportunity to deliver those\nqualities that we aim to provide our clients. No, it makes a ton of sense. The whole process is we've talked about is a completely\nrules-based approach but it is actively managed. So, where do you think the team adds the most\nvalue and can you also talk to me about how often you're re-running the process to either\nselect new names, add, remove, re-weight and you can just talk about that a little bit as well.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>It can be really the basis of the strategy as the fact that we don't feel that we are\ngood at predicting the future. Some might be able to do it, but we don't feel that we can. And so the strategy is really based on what we know versus what we don't know. So it's based on three very simple economic principles which are maximized earnings growth\nbecause nothing drives performance like earnings growth when you buy a stock, you get\nto share that company, if that company is growing great, the value is going to grow.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to maintain a portfolio consistently that has significantly higher earnings\ngrowth in the S&P because, again, nothing drives performance like earnings growth. Historically,\nthe portfolio is averaged around 12 to 13% earnings growth versus the S&P, which is around 67. That's in B's earnings can be wildly volatile. But over the longer in the average around 67,\nthere's reason to think that maybe even that begins to decline a little bit. But regardless, that's about a 6 to 7% gap on average that we maintain that we would expect to\ndrive performance.</p>\n<p>But of the long run, stocks can be noisy,\nright? You've got people buying and selling based on different reasons, emotions and so\nequal weighting takes advantage of that noise. Now for us, as far as equal weighting versus\nalternative weightings, that's something that I've thought about a lot. In that really touches on\nan important philosophical point of our strategy which as many managers have heard, maybe not\nheard, but lean toward more concentrated approaches because that's a way to differentiate yourself\nfrom the indexes potentially provide outsized returns.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"The valuation is the way in which we value companies is\ncertainly one of the biggest differentiators.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"So, the difference between passive and active or the definition, I feel like is ever changing.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Cogswell breaks down how RUNN combines a core equity portfolio of 30\u201350 high-conviction U.S.</li>\n<li>This allows the fund to dial down risk during market stress and re-enter more aggressively during recovery phases.</li>\n<li>The equity sleeve of the portfolio focuses on quality companies with strong free cash flow and sustainable growth\u2014avoiding overvalued, speculative names.</li>\n<li>Cogswell notes that RUNN is actively managed daily, with oversight to ensure discipline in both the equity and fixed income allocations.</li>\n<li>Designed for use as a core equity holding or a risk-managed growth strategy, RUNN offers advisors and investors an efficient, transparent vehicle to navigate unpredictable markets.</li>\n<li>With a track record rooted in the firm\u2019s SMA history and now offered in a more tax-efficient ETF format, the fund aims to deliver smoother performance without sacrificing long-term upside.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Seth Cogswell highlights important considerations around small & mid cap.

    "content": "<p>In this episode, Brad sits down with Eric Lutton, CIO of Sound Income Strategies, to discuss the firm\u2019s actively managed ETF: FXED, and its unique approach to fixed income investing.Eric shares his professional journey from trading in the pits of Chicago to managing institutional assets and ultimately building out Sound Income\u2019s fixed income platform. The firm has grown from managing $30M with one advisor to nearly $4B with over 100 advisors, all through organic growth. At the core of their approach is a clear focus on income generation\u2014particularly for retirees and conservative investors looking to preserve capital and generate steady cash flow.Eric explains that FXED was created to solve two problems: making the firm\u2019s core-plus fixed income strategy available to smaller accounts and addressing the lack of fixed income ETFs that combine traditional bonds with higher-yielding alternatives like BDCs, REITs, preferreds, and non-core bond ETFs.He outlines how the portfolio targets around 70-75% fixed coupon instruments and layers in non-traditional income-generating securities\u2014especially those with lower correlation to investment grade bonds\u2014to deliver better risk-adjusted returns than broad benchmarks like the Agg. He discusses their bottom-up selection process, focus on management quality in BDCs and REITs, and commitment to avoiding names with poor underwriting or operational risks.FXED is actively managed to allow dynamic rebalancing between investment-grade and high-yield allocations depending on market conditions. Eric makes the case that active management in fixed income still has an edge\u2014unlike equities, where alpha is increasingly hard to find. The fund aims to outperform by overweighting stronger names and avoiding the losers\u2014something passive indexes can\u2019t do.He emphasizes that FXED is especially useful for retirees or near-retirees who need reliable income and want to avoid relying too heavily on equities for yield. With a target yield in the upper 6% range, the fund allows for reduced capital commitment to fixed income, freeing up room for growth investments or risk-free cash buffers elsewhere in the portfolio.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Eric Lutton covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>What we're trying\nto say is, all right, if this client has a target return, let's say their need is 6%. Well, if they were to pick up the Ag or a traditional investment grade bond fund, they're not\ngoing to get 6% yield. I'm, you know, I'm free with the Ag is yielding right now, pretty low to\nunless it's who's up together. That's how much I follow it now because we're focused on\na little more growth than that, but that's, that a lot of those traditional funds aren't going\nto meet that need.</p>\n<p>So, here's an opportunity where we're adding\nmore yield and since they're lower correlated, you know, the higher risk of just to return. So,\nwe fill that's what's adding value to the portfolio versus just fine as you put out, as you said\nthe act.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So, that's when we launched it. So, what makes it, what gives it that your strategy, the uniqueness? I mean, it looks like\nyou're blending traditional core bond fixed income with other things, like BDC's reads,\npreferred, some other specialty bond ETF. So, like, what's the thinking behind that structure? And what makes this way of investing in fixed income a little bit more advantageous than just\ngoing out and buying, you know, the Ag?</p>\n<p>There are times,\nor I was like, you know, I'd love to go sitting 30% cash right now and go play golf because this\nis just going to get bad, but you have to understand, someone's using fixed and using that strategy,\nthey're getting a dividend every two weeks. So, what happens if I have to have a cash balance\nand I do not want to cut that dividend? It's better to look at the best companies we can\ninvest in during that time because we need to stay fully invested and people just have to understand,\nthere's going to be some level downside risk.</p>\n<p>So I've had a few positions down here, private bank,\nrunning their fixed income and helping out with equities and then an RIA hedge fund and then\nactually did a stint on the sell side after 08 selling, helping RIAs out with their fixed income\nneeds. So building portfolio, selling bonds, trading bonds for them. And over 10 years ago,\nmutual friend put me in contact with Fave Strand, who's the principal of sounding\nincome strategies. Brian Matt now and Dave wanted to start an RIA.</p>\n<p>So,\nthat's not a horrible thing. Obviously, we want to see the leverage stake fairly low. I'm in good managers, usually keep it pretty low. And then with the rates, you're dealing with 11,\n12 different sectors and equity rates. I don't go into mortgage rates, because now I'm betting on\nhow good as management, playing the trade spread game. In other words, we'll borrow an X and we're\ngoing to buy more each paper at Y. And you're always trying to guess, as management good at that\nspread game.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"So that's why I was introduced to\nderivative instruments and kind of a fast-paced crowd.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"And what makes this way of investing in fixed income a little bit more advantageous than just\ngoing out and buying, you know, the Ag?\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>With a target yield in the upper 6% range, the fund allows for reduced capital commitment to fixed income, freeing up room for growth investments or risk-free cash buffers elsewhere in the portfolio.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in income investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in alternatives relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Eric Lutton highlights important considerations around fixed income.

    "content": "<p>In this episode of Behind the Ticker, Brad Roth interviews Ryan Thomes, Co-Portfolio Manager at Hotchkis & Wiley, to discuss the launch and strategy behind the firm\u2019s newest ETF\u2014HWSM, the Hotchkis & Wiley SMID Cap Diversified Value ETF. Ryan shares his career journey from investment consulting to portfolio management, explaining how his early due diligence work led him to join the very firm he once evaluated. Over the past 17 years at Hotchkis & Wiley, Ryan has been deeply involved in refining the firm\u2019s value-based equity strategies and co-manages both the small-cap and SMID strategies.</p>\n<h2>About Ryan Thomes and Hotchkis & Wiley</h2>\n<p>The conversation centers on the HWSM ETF, which launched in early 2024 and represents a natural extension of Hotchkis & Wiley\u2019s long-standing small-cap value process. Although the ETF is new, the underlying investment methodology dates back over 20 years. Ryan breaks down the firm\u2019s three-step process: proprietary quantitative modeling, human analyst review, and thoughtful portfolio construction. Unlike traditional quant screens, Hotchkis & Wiley\u2019s models attempt to emulate how a human analyst would value companies based on normalized mid-cycle earnings rather than current market conditions. This combination of rigorous modeling and fundamental judgment allows them to focus on out-of-favor, under-followed stocks with long-term value potential.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>HWSM typically holds between 150\u2013200 names, balancing diversification with high active share, and utilizes a tiered weighting system that ties directly to fundamental risk ratings. Analysts assess companies across three pillars\u2014business quality, balance sheet strength, and corporate governance\u2014and these scores directly impact the weightings in the portfolio.

    "content": "<p>In this episode of Behind the Ticker, host Brad Roth speaks with Kirk McDonald, Portfolio Manager at Argent Capital Management, about his unique path from Air Force pilot to managing the Argent MidCap ETF (ticker: AMID). McDonald shares how his firm\u2019s mission to deliver both strong investment performance and top-tier client service inspired their move into the ETF space. With a deep-rooted philosophy focused on \u201cenduring businesses,\u201d Argent seeks companies with consistent cash flow growth, durable competitive advantages, and strong capital allocation by management.</p>\n<h2>About Kirk McDonald and Argent Capital</h2>\n<p>Kirk dives into the construction of AMID, which holds a concentrated portfolio of 40\u201350 midcap names with low turnover\u2014around 20% annually. What differentiates Argent\u2019s approach is the integration of both quantitative modeling and fundamental research, a methodology McDonald calls \u201cquantamental.\u201d This framework is built on 25 fundamental factors that guide stock selection, continually refined to ensure alignment with their long-term investing philosophy. Kirk shares a memorable analogy comparing portfolio candidates to pigs at a trough\u2014emphasizing the constant drive to prioritize younger, hungrier contenders that can generate future outperformance.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>McDonald also breaks down key portfolio holdings, including Copart and Fortinet, and explains how AMID performs across different market cycles. While the strategy may lag during market regime shifts, it tends to outperform once trends stabilize. He stresses the importance of risk management, drawing from his aviation background to describe a systematic process embedded throughout the stock selection lifecycle.</p>\n<p>Finally, McDonald explains how AMID fits into broader client portfolios, describing midcap stocks as a \u201cforgotten\u201d asset class underrepresented in most investor allocations despite historically delivering strong returns. He also previews Argent\u2019s growing ETF lineup, which now includes large cap and small cap offerings and will eventually expand to cover SMID and high-yield strategies.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Kirk McDonald covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>Or how do you view risk management? Yeah, so that actually goes back to my Air Force days where risk management was invented for aviation. And so we started the risk management process when we were planning a mission. So it, so we do the exact same thing with the Argent midcap strategy. Risk management is built in throughout. When we're considering even adding a name to a portfolio. Throughout the research process, we're always thinking. What are its exposures to different risk characteristics?</p>\n<p>So there's 40 to 50 securities in there, right now there's 43. And the turnover over a long span of time is about 20% a year. So we're looking for these enduring businesses and we want to own them as long as we possibly can and really take advantage of that compounding cash flows over time. And I think our edge over other mid-cap portfolio managers out there is this combination of quantitative and qualitative or fundamental investing that we do.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So we just open two new ETFs in addition to Amid. We have a big A, B, I, G, which invest in large caps stocks. It's our large cap core strategy and a little A, L, L, which is our small cap strategy. So they're just exact clones of our SM separately managed accounts that with fairly long track records and those two asset classes. Essentially, we have two more investment strategies here, an urgent high yielding portfolio as well as a SMid cap.</p>\n<p>So some of my names are the portfolio that are long term holdings. I've had conviction in if their stock price is underperforming significantly. I'll take advantage and sell some of the relative winners. Trim them actually not sell them. And then reinvest in some of the, the lower, the lower performing underperforming stocks. So having kind of relatively number of small holding,\nwe'll talk a little bit about the risk management process. Is that almost inherently embedded in the monthly kind of reallocation of capital a little bit?</p>\n<p>So I was a quantitative research analyst and then a quantitative portfolio manager as building models of factors. And for people that are familiar and a factor is essentially. Balance financial ratio like from the income statement or balance sheet simple swam would be like price to earnings ratio. But it's a financial ratio that correlates with stocks outperform the market over time. So I was building these models and managing purely quantitative portfolios. And when I came over to urgent 14 years ago, they hired me to build them a stock selection model.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"So I went and flew to the C5 Galaxy, which is the exact opposite was the biggest plane in the Air Force.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"So that's why we're seeing a lot of people kind of move to the ETF space.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In this episode of Behind the Ticker, host Brad Roth speaks with Kirk McDonald, Portfolio Manager at Argent Capital Management, about his unique path from Air Force pilot to managing the Argent MidCap ETF (ticker: AMID).</li>\n<li>Kirk dives into the construction of AMID, which holds a concentrated portfolio of 40\u201350 midcap names with low turnover\u2014around 20% annually.</li>\n<li>McDonald also breaks down key portfolio holdings, including Copart and Fortinet, and explains how AMID performs across different market cycles.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Kirk McDonald highlights important considerations around income investing.

    "content": "<p>In this episode of Behind the Ticker, Brad Roth sits down with Rob Thummel, Senior Portfolio Manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors, to dive into the firm\u2019s active ETF, the Tortoise Essential Energy Fund (Ticker: TPZ). Rob shares his decades-long journey in the energy sector\u2014from working in gas stations and oilfields as a teenager to helping lead one of the most focused energy investment firms in the country. Tortoise Capital is devoted entirely to energy, aiming to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns by investing across the full spectrum of the sector, including infrastructure, utilities, and renewables\u2014not just traditional oil and gas producers.</p>\n<h2>About Rob Thummel and Tortoise Capital</h2>\n<p>TPZ, which recently transitioned from a closed-end fund to an active ETF, offers investors a dynamic approach to the evolving energy landscape. Rob explains how the fund is positioned to capture opportunities stemming from electrification and increased U.S. energy exports, with particular focus on natural gas and liquid infrastructure. He emphasizes that energy is no longer just about oil\u2014natural gas and electricity are central to powering data centers and AI advancements, and TPZ is designed to align with that megatrend.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>The portfolio maintains an active share of 86%, reflecting its substantial divergence from traditional benchmarks like the S&P Energy Index or ETFs like XLE. TPZ typically holds 80-90% in equities and 10-20% in fixed income, with additional option overlays to generate income and reduce volatility. Rob describes the fund\u2019s hybrid approach\u2014combining top-down macro analysis with bottom-up fundamental research\u2014to find undervalued names with strong cash flows and management quality.</p>\n<p>With a current dividend yield of about 5% and one-year performance exceeding 40%, TPZ has outpaced many passive energy benchmarks by leaning into secular shifts and tactically avoiding cyclical pitfalls. Rob positions TPZ as a core energy allocation for diversified portfolios, not just for total return potential, but for its robust income stream and long-term exposure to the energy-AI convergence.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Rob Thummel covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>Focus on the energy sector. Really, I've always seen a huge opportunity in the energy sector because of the essential nature of it. And so our goal obviously is to deliver the highest risk of just returns we can for clients because energy is so important. Obviously, there's a lot going on in energy and frankly, you know, there are a lot of market cycles in energy, a lot of market cycles in general in the broad market. But our goal is to position clients we think or the best opportunities are in the energy sector.</p>\n<p>Our active ETF can identify the future opportunities and where the puck is going in energy and move there and move there quickly and that's and that's that's what we've done and that's really helped us. Really propel us and and provide that that that return that excess return over and beyond over and beyond what the index has has delivered. So here's a million dollar question right for someone already has or is building a diversified model portfolio. What role do you see TPC playing you know should investors view it as a core energy allocation should they look at it is an income generating sleeve or maybe more of an opportunistic position.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>And because there's there is no way AI without AI there's no AI without energy infrastructure and so that that that that's that's what we're really excited about because we think to say. AI opportunities a long term secular trend it offers a catalyst for the energy sector a growth catalyst for the energy sector so energy is already providing a lot of. stable income for for investors and and that's not going away but now we've got the end we've got income and now we've got a growth catalyst that I think well really position a sector going for.</p>\n<p>In a period of declining commodity prices to actually be a little defensive but also be in an early stage growth story that's really not been fully recognized by the stock market yet. So let's take a look at performance I looked at performance the fun as a one year return of over 40% so first of all congratulations. Can you talk about a little bit about one of the key drivers that help propel that return over last year. Yeah so so what I would say is you have the energy sectors is made people listen as called no and may and may be even share this view has been really under invested and and I think really under appreciated for for a series of years really all the way back to 2020.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"Actually got rid of the discounts for the for the closed end fund shareholders consolidated a you know, you get now you got to benefit a scale a bit with now one active ETF and like I said gives us the opportunity now to look forward and and and and really position the portfolio.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"But there's a lot going on in the energy sector and that's that's that's what I like to say is that's why tortoise.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>TPZ, which recently transitioned from a closed-end fund to an active ETF, offers investors a dynamic approach to the evolving energy landscape.</li>\n<li>Rob explains how the fund is positioned to capture opportunities stemming from electrification and increased U.S.</li>\n<li>He emphasizes that energy is no longer just about oil\u2014natural gas and electricity are central to powering data centers and AI advancements, and TPZ is designed to align with that megatrend.</li>\n<li>TPZ typically holds 80-90% in equities and 10-20% in fixed income, with additional option overlays to generate income and reduce volatility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Rob Thummel highlights important considerations around energy.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of Behind the Ticker, Bob Elliott, co-founder and Chief Investment Officer of Unlimited, discussed the firm\u2019s mission to democratize hedge fund strategies through innovative ETF structures. Drawing on his experience managing strategies at Bridgewater Associates and running a $125 million venture capital fund, Elliott launched Unlimited to address what he sees as fundamental inefficiencies in traditional hedge funds\u2014high fees, limited access, and tax-inefficient vehicles. Unlimited\u2019s approach uses proprietary technology to replicate hedge fund strategies at lower costs, inside liquid, tax-efficient ETFs.</p>\n<h2>About Bob Elliot and Unlimited Funds</h2>\n<p>The firm\u2019s latest offering, the Unlimited HFGM ETF (ticker: HFGM), seeks to replicate the returns of global macro hedge funds, offering a 2x exposure to the strategy at just 95 basis points. Elliott explained that global macro is one of the most attractive and diversifying hedge fund styles due to its flexibility across asset classes\u2014currencies, commodities, rates, equities\u2014and its historically low correlation to traditional 60/40 portfolios. By leveraging a machine learning-driven process, HFGM infers the positioning of roughly 500 macro hedge fund managers in near real-time, using public market data and return streams to replicate their exposures.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>Elliott emphasized that HFGM is fully systematic, with daily updates to inferred manager positioning and weekly average rebalancing. The ETF primarily uses futures contracts for efficiency, allowing both long and short exposure across global macro markets while benefiting from tax-friendly ETF structuring. Elliott stressed that the firm avoids \u201cblack box\u201d opacity by grounding its machine learning in intuitive, transparent modeling\u2014essentially scaling the same logic any investor might use to reverse-engineer a manager\u2019s trades, but with far greater accuracy and breadth.</p>\n<p>He positioned HFGM and Unlimited\u2019s broader ETF suite as part of a shift in portfolio construction\u2014from the old 60/40 model to a more modern 50/30/20 framework, where 20% is allocated to alternatives, including both liquid and illiquid strategies. HFGM, with its manager-diversified exposure, ease of execution, and lack of paperwork or K-1s, offers a compelling way for advisors and institutions to gain hedge fund-like exposure without the drawbacks of traditional LP structures.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Bob Elliot covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>Today we have on Bob Elliott. He's a chief investment officer over at unlimited funds and we are talking about their newest ETF, the unlimited HF GM global macro ETF, ticker HF GM. It is a global macro hedge fund replication strategy, although it offers two X leverage on that index. We talk about the benefits of alternatives in the portfolio and we talk about how Bob and the team over at unlimited runs their entire process. There is a small section of this podcast.</p>\n<p>It's not how hedge fund managers operate and the reason why that is is because there are transactions costs that they have to deal with and so what it means is they can only move so fast if you're managing any reasonable amount of money. You can't instantaneously shift positions and so that actually gives a real advantage because what it allows us to do is to look at the path of returns and infer what set of adjacent portfolios must have described that path of returns that we're seeing given the market action.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>That is a good compliment to the rest of the portfolio which in a lot of ways in one form or another is a long are long only strategies. Right so I'll let you make the list here but just for the listener. What is the benefit of doing this in an ETF wrapper getting I'm saying getting hedge fund or alternative exposure in an ETF wrapper rather than going direct to an LP and getting that exposure directly like what are the main benefits.</p>\n<p>Bring those to market in an ETF wrapper. But instead of just taking the returns out of the boxes, the managers offer them what we're doing is we're targeting a two X return. So using the same position, the same position understanding targeting a two X return. And also doing that at a much lower fee point than two and twenty at ninety five basis points. And so that HFGM, which is our global macro product is the first one of those that kind of gives you a whole sense of it.</p>\n<p>Hey Bob, welcome back to the show. Thanks so much for having me. So why don't you just give everybody a quick refresher about who you are, what you do, and what all unlimited ETFs is trying to accomplish their clients. Yeah, I've been in the 220 businesses. I like to call it for a couple of decades now. I spent the majority of my career at the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates almost 15 years, where I was creating investment strategies across a wide range of different asset classes.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"Yeah, unfortunately since we launched our first product we got it idea I've had the opportunity to talk to.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The firm\u2019s latest offering, the Unlimited HFGM ETF (ticker: HFGM), seeks to replicate the returns of global macro hedge funds, offering a 2x exposure to the strategy at just 95 basis points.</li>\n<li>He positioned HFGM and Unlimited\u2019s broader ETF suite as part of a shift in portfolio construction\u2014from the old 60/40 model to a more modern 50/30/20 framework, where 20% is allocated to alternatives, including both liquid and illiquid strategies.</li>\n<li>HFGM, with its manager-diversified exposure, ease of execution, and lack of paperwork or K-1s, offers a compelling way for advisors and institutions to gain hedge fund-like exposure without the drawbacks of traditional LP structures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Bob Elliot highlights important considerations around etf structure.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of Behind the Ticker, Brad Neuman, Director of Market Strategy and Portfolio Manager at Alger, joined the show to discuss the firm\u2019s rich history in growth investing and the launch of their latest ETF: Alger Russell Innovation ETF (ticker: INVN). Neuman, who has a 25-year investment background spanning bottom-up and top-down roles on both the buy and sell sides, explained how Alger\u2019s philosophy of \u201cpositive dynamic change\u201d\u2014a principle rooted in identifying growth opportunities amid market disruption\u2014has remained consistent since the firm\u2019s founding in 1964.</p>\n<h2>About Brad Neuman and Alger</h2>\n<p>Neuman described Alger\u2019s long-standing emphasis on change as the foundation for identifying outperforming businesses. This philosophy is implemented through deep, fundamental research conducted by a seasoned analyst team that conducts proprietary field work\u2014speaking directly with customers, competitors, and suppliers. While most of Alger\u2019s strategies have been actively managed and bottom-up, INVN marks a shift toward a more systematic, top-down process designed to isolate innovation as an investable factor.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>The INVN ETF seeks to directly invest in innovation by identifying companies with strong R&D investment that is underappreciated by the market. Starting with the Russell 1000, Alger removes the bottom third of companies ranked by free cash flow margin to avoid early-stage or inefficient businesses. From the remaining universe, they select the top 50 companies based on R&D-to-enterprise value. The result is an equally weighted portfolio reconstituted quarterly to maintain exposure to what Neuman calls \u201cHIPP\u201d stocks\u2014Highly Innovative, but Prudently Priced. This approach avoids overlap with typical growth benchmarks and excludes megacap names like Apple, whose R&D may be large in absolute terms but not relative to their vast market caps.</p>\n<p>Neuman positioned INVN as a mid-cap core exposure that can serve as a replacement for traditional passive or active mid-cap strategies, while solving for issues like overconcentration in large-cap tech and inflated market valuations. With low turnover, high active share, and a valuation profile significantly below traditional growth indices, INVN provides a unique, quant-driven solution for investors looking to allocate directly to innovation.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Brad Neuman covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>We invest in research and development, companies have a lot of research and development that's being undervalued by the market. So it's research and development relative to market value. So maybe it's helpful now if I take you through just the whole methodology. It's not that's complicated, but so we start with the Russell 1000. And we first really do two things to Russell 1000 to get down to the portfolio. We first weed out the bottom, one third, a free cash flow margin companies.</p>\n<p>That doesn't mean it's not a great company,\nor even a good stock. It's just that the model wouldn't say that its research\ndevelopment is undervalued. So the average, the weighted median research\nand development rather from market value in the ETF,\nis about 6%. So if you're talking about these $3, $3, $3 companies,\nthey are very innovative. But in my spend, tens of billions of dollars\non research and development, but they don't spend\nwhat's necessary relative to their market cap,\nwhich in this case would be $1,580 billion\nto get them included in the index.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So we share with Russell 1000, we're left with the top two thirds of free cash flow margin companies. From those companies, within those companies, we simply write them all by research and development spending over the past 12 months relative to their market value,\nor to get technical enterprise value, which is the market capitalization of the equity plus the value of the debt plus minority interest and preferred stock less cash, but essentially the market value of the company.</p>\n<p>Well, one of the beautiful things about in my opinion, the index and the ETF that follows it is that it has been created. It has very well overlapped with the benchmarks and, you know, I think most people will find some relatively significant portion of the magnificent 70th portfolio today. This has, you know, a high 90s active share percentage, meaning more than 90, you know, high 90% of the strategy or ETF is different. Then the benchmark, whether you look at the S&P 500, the NASDAQ composite, the Q's, the Russell 1000 growth and any of those things, so it's really different.</p>\n<p>our companies, the way I'll think of this innovative,\nis because we are using that research development\nrelative to market value. So Apple may be innovative, although I would argue\nthat their innovation is very visible. Everyone knows they're going to come out with another phone. Every September, and most of the value of the company\nis actually based on its existing products. So I wouldn't say in the model wouldn't say\nthat Apple is under value based on its research\ndevelopment pipeline.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"Our belief is that this is a much longer term signal,\nthe innovation factor, and so we don't have to turn the portfolio\nover very much, that's why it's only quarterly.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>While most of Alger\u2019s strategies have been actively managed and bottom-up, INVN marks a shift toward a more systematic, top-down process designed to isolate innovation as an investable factor.</li>\n<li>The INVN ETF seeks to directly invest in innovation by identifying companies with strong R&D investment that is underappreciated by the market.</li>\n<li>Neuman positioned INVN as a mid-cap core exposure that can serve as a replacement for traditional passive or active mid-cap strategies, while solving for issues like overconcentration in large-cap tech and inflated market valuations.</li>\n<li>With low turnover, high active share, and a valuation profile significantly below traditional growth indices, INVN provides a unique, quant-driven solution for investors looking to allocate directly to innovation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Brad Neuman highlights important considerations around quantitative investing.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of Behind the Ticker, Wayne Penello, founder of NextGen EMP, shared the fascinating journey that led him to launch the NextGen Efficient Market Portfolio Plus ETF (ticker: EMPB). With over 40 years of experience as a commodity trader\u2014including a decade on the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange and years advising global trading firms\u2014Penello developed a deep understanding of risk management. He later patented the Performance Risk Management System, which earned his clients over $13 billion in hedging profits and was detailed in his book, Risk as an Asset. After selling his firm, Penello turned his attention to equities, frustrated by the industry\u2019s overreliance on diversification and lack of active risk management, ultimately leading to the creation of EMPB.</p>\n<h2>About Wayne Penello and NextGen EMP</h2>\n<p>EMPB is a long/short equity ETF designed to actively manage systemic market risk using a proprietary, statistically driven methodology Penello describes as a \u201cfoggy ball\u201d\u2014an imperfect but highly effective algorithm that identifies the weakest sectors (\u201cnags of the market\u201d) and shorts them to dampen volatility. Rather than attempting to predict market direction or time the best 90 days, the fund focuses on avoiding the worst periods, which historically have the most destructive impact on long-term performance. The ETF holds about 16 sector or thematic ETFs, balancing long and short exposures to achieve a Sharpe ratio above 2, with the aim of consistently outperforming the S&P 500 while maintaining a maximum drawdown of less than 10%.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>A key differentiator for EMPB is its accessibility: Penello was determined to build a sophisticated hedge-fund-like strategy for everyday investors, not just accredited institutions. By launching as an ETF rather than a private fund, NextGen EMP made the strategy available to anyone with $25, offering hedge-fund-caliber active management in a tax-efficient, low-minimum format. Despite an advertised expense ratio of 2.21%, Penello explained that the effective net cost to investors is closer to 1% or less when accounting for the offsetting interest income from short positions and dividends on long holdings. The fund is rebalanced monthly.</p>\n<p>Penello positioned EMPB as a core equity exposure solution rather than an alternatives sleeve, emphasizing its potential appeal to both young investors seeking equity growth with controlled risk and retirees who cannot afford major portfolio drawdowns. With a disciplined, systematic process that removes emotional decision-making and a structure that works efficiently within tax-advantaged accounts, EMPB represents what Penello calls the \u201cnext generation\u201d of equity investing.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Wayne Penello covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>The equity style returns let's say 10 to 12 percent a year and you're taking risk to do that. And the other party portfolio was getting bond type returns which back four years ago was nothing today it's 4 percent but it's still nothing. And I said there must be a better way so I spent the last four years working on a methodology that would. Allow me to create a portfolio that one managed risk without sacrificing returns and then two made it available to the average investor you didn't need to be a qualified investor.</p>\n<p>And what I found is that the market predictability on an individual level as and I would agree with Phama. I mean, nobody, nobody knows what's going to happen tomorrow. Nobody knows really what's going to go up or down. So what we took the approaches that we wanted to use pieces of the equity space as a hedge since all of the various different industry sectors are reasonably well correlated. That is typically 70% or higher. And we said, can we find a way to use the industry sectors themselves as a way to hedge the systemic risk that is when it's a risk off trade and everybody is selling everything.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>And then around the year 2000 I started a consultancy to design and maintain hedge programs for companies because it was obvious to me that people weren't focusing on the right elements to manage risk properly. And I eventually patented that methodology that's called the performance risk management system. And our clients using the performance risk management system were paid over $13 billion for hedging successfully. That cut the attention of Forbes books and they approached me and I published that methodology in a book called risk is in asset that's available on Amazon.</p>\n<p>So we have portfolios that on the during board that are themed and them. And they perform as well. And we have long only that perform as well. But they all have slightly higher risk components. And I think they'll be attracted to investors at some point in the future. Because no matter how you tell people that don't try to time the market. Everybody tries that time the market. And I can envision a world where there will be a bunch of people to say,\nOK, I think the market's going back up now.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"As we go through life, and we see what happens in the real world, we'll find out.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"Anything we did was new because nobody had ever had the opportunity to do it before.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Rather than attempting to predict market direction or time the best 90 days, the fund focuses on avoiding the worst periods, which historically have the most destructive impact on long-term performance.</li>\n<li>The ETF holds about 16 sector or thematic ETFs, balancing long and short exposures to achieve a Sharpe ratio above 2, with the aim of consistently outperforming the S&P 500 while maintaining a maximum drawdown of less than 10%.</li>\n<li>A key differentiator for EMPB is its accessibility: Penello was determined to build a sophisticated hedge-fund-like strategy for everyday investors, not just accredited institutions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Wayne Penello highlights important considerations around income investing.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of Behind the Ticker, Rob Harvey, Vice President at Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA), shared his personal journey into asset management and gave an in-depth look at DFA\u2019s unique approach to building portfolios, particularly their work in the ETF space. Harvey described how he first encountered Dimensional while managing external asset managers at Cisco Systems, where their emphasis on evidence-based investing and disdain for market predictions immediately stood out. After attending a Dimensional conference and hearing academic legends like Eugene Fama and Ken French present, Harvey was convinced and eventually joined DFA, relocating to Austin, Texas.Harvey explained that DFA\u2019s core mission is to help investors achieve their financial goals by providing investment solutions based on robust academic research, rather than focusing on marketing or chasing hot trends. He emphasized Dimensional\u2019s long-standing partnership model with financial advisors, which prioritizes education, client communication, and long-term outcomes over product sales. This commitment to advisors and evidence-based investing remains central even as DFA expands its reach through ETFs, making their historically advisor-only strategies accessible to a broader audience without compromising their foundational principles.The conversation focused heavily on DFA\u2019s investment philosophy, particularly their emphasis on factors like size, value, and profitability, which are systematically applied across all portfolios. Harvey noted that DFA is highly disciplined in vetting new research before incorporating it into their strategies, ensuring that any new factors\u2014such as profitability, which was added in 2012\u2014meet a high bar for robustness and persistence across time and markets. DFA\u2019s portfolios are managed actively on a daily basis, providing flexibility to capture real-world developments in ways traditional index funds cannot, while maintaining low fees and broad diversification.Harvey also provided an overview of DFAI, Dimensional\u2019s International Core Equity ETF. He described DFAI as a market-wide, low-tracking-error strategy that lightly tilts toward premiums like small size, value, and profitability, offering enhanced expected returns over a standard index fund. DFAI differs from traditional international index funds by including a broader set of securities, especially micro-caps, and by incorporating real-time momentum screens to avoid value traps and boost performance. Harvey positioned DFAI as an ideal core international equity holding for advisors seeking to move beyond passive indexing without sacrificing diversification or cost efficiency.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Rob Harvey covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>You will see more ETFs. You will see more mutual funds launch in the future. So you mentioned the firm is active. How do you guys think about that daily portfolio management process, really enhancing return\nand enhancing the approach compared to just buy and hold, let's just index.</p>\n<p>And then you look at other stocks out there right now, what's doing really well in Europe,\nwhat's we're doing really well on DFI, defense stocks, they're doing really well. So if you have a portfolio that's focusing on smaller, deeper value of higher profit\nrelated securities, which is what we know drives returns in the equity space, but you're\nholding a defense stock that's in the top 5% in terms of the performance for the rest\nof the international market.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So that's a research piece. The product piece is also important. If we found ways to improve the microcap portfolio a little bit here a little bit\nthere over time, that's great. But we're not necessarily serving investors or investors or clients as well as we could. If we know that we can also do things in other areas of the market that are also value\nad. So you've seen not just in the product, wrapper, like ETF, like you mentioned, but also where\nare you going to be positioning yourself?</p>\n<p>We're sick into our guns over time. So there's a consistency aspect too. That doesn't mean, again, that they're going to outperform every day, but I think that\nconsistency and approach gives investors more confidence because they know what they're\ngoing to see when they take up the account statement. If value got crushed last year versus growth, you should expect us to see a value strategy\nunderperform. That is part of your, that's part of the experience that you should anticipate, right?</p>\n<p>Like, and what do you position yourself again? Historically, dimensional has been very much a component of the market. Those are flagship funds, like a value strategy or a small catcher. We do have market-wide strategies, but we're known for component strategies. Some of our most popular ETFs are low tracking error, high degree of overlap, market-wide\nportfolios with good implementation and very light tilt towards the premiums.</p>\n<p>Part of the evolution of the firm has been on the research aspect. So I think about how the national's grown. There's been two key areas, I think, that I've been driving the growth. What is, how do you make your portfolio is better? Well, what you're asking about, which is the research and the other is, how do you offer\ninvestment solutions that better fit the needs of your clients? So I'll talk about the research piece first, which is, how do you improve your portfolios\nover time?</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"We do a lot and our approach, I think, is different from that of other asset managers\nbecause I think really, if you wanted to summarize it succinctly, you'd say dimensional\ngoal is to help and clients reach their financial objectives by providing great investment\nsolutions.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Harvey positioned DFAI as an ideal core international equity holding for advisors seeking to move beyond passive indexing without sacrificing diversification or cost efficiency.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in portfolio construction relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in quantitative investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Rob Harvey highlights important considerations around quantitative investing.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of Behind the Ticker, Clark Allen, Head of ETFs at Horizon Investments, shared his journey from public accounting and family office investing to leading Horizon\u2019s entrance into the ETF space. With a deep background in institutional asset management and quantitative research, Allen joined Horizon to help bridge the gap between sophisticated investment strategies and emotionally resonant, goals-based planning for financial advisors and their clients. Horizon, founded in the mid-1990s, evolved from a wealth manager into a strategist firm with a focus on outcome-oriented models. Today, the firm offers a blend of mutual funds, OCIO services, and now, actively managed ETFs as part of its growing product suite.</p>\n<h2>About Clark Allen and Horizon Investments</h2>\n<p>Horizon\u2019s ETF push began with two initial launches, BENJ and HBTA, and the firm has filed for seven more ETFs in 2024. Allen explained that Horizon\u2019s motivation was largely advisor-driven\u2014many advisors were already using Horizon\u2019s mutual funds and model portfolios but needed ETF-based solutions to better integrate with their workflows. BENJ, the Horizon Landmark ETF, is a cash management strategy built around box spreads, offering a T-bill-plus total return without kicking off taxable income. Allen emphasized that this feature is ideal for model portfolios, particularly in retirement distribution strategies, where advisors need liquidity but prefer to manage tax exposure and reinvestment activity with precision.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>HBTA, the firm\u2019s second ETF, is designed as a high-beta equity strategy with put spreads to offer greater upside capture than the S&P 500. Allen described it as a product built for certainty\u2014not to time markets, but to provide clear expectations around performance, particularly for advisors seeking risk-aligned tools for growth-oriented allocations. He noted that many advisors in Horizon\u2019s OCIO network had asked for such solutions to complement their existing exposures without relying on small caps or thematic tech names.</p>\n<p>What sets Horizon apart, according to Allen, is its emphasis on being a solution provider rather than a product pusher. The firm\u2019s ETF lineup is crafted to fit within model portfolios and financial plans, not just to chase the latest trend. Horizon\u2019s focus remains on outcome-driven investing, where each ETF serves a clear role\u2014whether providing liquidity, risk-managed equity exposure, or a building block for custom advisor models.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Clark Allen covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>And so that helps you stomach the volatility\nthat you are probably taking on with the equity risk that you likely need to have a high probability\nsuccess. But with a high liquidity bucket, if you just ignore the fact that you're getting volatility\nin your equity portfolio, or even equity fixed income mix, and just focus on your liquidity bucket,\nthat's going to be able to provide you the spending you need to meet your needs. And so this is\nan ETF that's designed specifically to fit that liquidity bucket.</p>\n<p>It can be similar, white label and additional costs that comes with that. We have hired a trading sub advisor to allow us to scale pretty quickly because we've\ntraded mutual funds, we've traded resumes, but there's a lot more to trading ETFs in terms\nof the in-kind process, the APs dealing with the market makers, the exchange, and there's\na lot of different other pieces that we work familiar with. And so coming to market with this many ETFs, let's just, we said, let's just partner\nwith somebody that's really good and we'll come up with the strategy, we'll come up with\nthe distribution, and we'll let them do the trading and execution on our behalf.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>And so we've launched a custom portfolio business, which is custom estimates, attack management. And then even more recently, now we've launched our first two ETFs, and we just filed for\nseven more, and there will be more to come this year where we're coming pretty quickly\ninto the Active ETF space, and simply because we see that there's a need. And again, we have solutions, and we see that there's gaps in those solutions that are offering\nadvisors, and we want to be able to have product to fill those needs and really serve these\nadvisors.</p>\n<p>And so I came here originally was just focused on the point research, the director of\ncontent research, portfolio management as well. And then more recently we've entered the ETF space and so it was promoted ahead of ETFs\nand overseeing not just sort of research efforts, but also execution and launching of our\nETF business. It's funny, you and I have fairly similar backgrounds. I did public accounting, but I was on the tax side and I lasted about one tax season and\nit was like that's enough for me.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"But ETFs have really been at the core of everything, and that's why we sell advise ETFs\nfor first trust, and it's really what's given us is the confidence that come to market\nwith so many ETFs this year, because we understand how ETFs work.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Today, the firm offers a blend of mutual funds, OCIO services, and now, actively managed ETFs as part of its growing product suite.</li>\n<li>HBTA, the firm\u2019s second ETF, is designed as a high-beta equity strategy with put spreads to offer greater upside capture than the S&P 500.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in growth investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Clark Allen highlights important considerations around fixed income.

    "content": "<p>In a recent special edition of Behind the Ticker recorded live at the Exchange ETF Conference, Paisley Nardini, Vice President and Client Portfolio Strategist at Simplify Asset Management, joined the show to discuss her path from bond trading to ETF strategy\u2014and dive into Simplify\u2019s Managed Futures Strategy ETF, ticker CTA. With a career that began on a bond trading desk and later evolved through roles at PIMCO and in institutional portfolio management, Nardini has developed a strong passion for bringing hedge-fund-caliber strategies to a broader investor base.</p>\n<h2>About Paisley Nardini and Simplify</h2>\n<p>Simplify launched in 2020 following a key SEC rule change that expanded the use of derivatives in ETFs. Since then, the firm has grown to over $7 billion in AUM across 35 ETFs, becoming known for its innovative use of options and derivatives. While often categorized as an \u201calternative ETF issuer,\u201d Nardini emphasized that Simplify\u2019s lineup includes not only pure diversifiers like CTA but also core active fixed income and systematic equity strategies. She described CTA as a capital-efficient, hedge-fund-style managed futures fund focused solely on commodities and interest rate futures\u2014excluding equities and currencies to offer a cleaner source of diversification.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>CTA stands out by employing a multi-signal model composed of four drivers: trend, mean reversion, intermarket (or risk-off), and carry. The trend signal captures directional market movements across short, medium, and long-term timeframes. The mean reversion signal acts as a counterbalance, scaling exposure when trends become extended. The intermarket factor assesses cross-asset relationships\u2014such as equities selling off while bonds rally\u2014to adjust positioning dynamically. Finally, the carry signal evaluates the interest rate curve to avoid negative carry in periods of inversion. This hedge-fund-inspired, daily-rebalanced model is powered by research from Altis Partners, a UK-based CTA firm.</p>\n<p>The fund uses futures contracts, which naturally embed leverage, but Simplify imposes a 25% margin-to-equity constraint to manage risk. Unlike many peers, CTA has no sector or position caps, allowing for high-conviction trades\u2014such as its profitable exposure to the cocoa market in 2023. Nardini also addressed the ETF\u2019s performance through volatile periods, highlighting its ability to pivot quickly, reduce drawdowns, and remain uncorrelated to both stocks and bonds. With negative correlation to equities and the potential for equity-like returns, CTA is increasingly being used as a key diversifier in modern model portfolios.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Paisley Nardini covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>There's a tremendous value or benefit to those of us that are combining this which 99.9% of us are with stocks with bonds and so when we have these periods of market drawdown whether it's in stocks or bonds. The benefit of a correlation perspective to smooth volatility to smooth the drawdowns. Is tremendous as it relates to portfolio construction. I can just pointing out again in February the most recent sell off we saw. The ability then to kind of pivot and take advantage of all the sudden asset prices are trending lower and the ability again to take short positions capitalized on that provided attractive absolute returns as the broader market selling off.</p>\n<p>We have one risk constraint in our CTA ETF which is a 25% margin to equity ratio and so the underlying noional exposure that we're achieving in the strategy is far greater than the margin that we have to post as collateral. And so again that 25% margin to equity ratio is imposed on us this is a loss just coming up with us so it is an outside third party so I think that helps with a bit of the checks and balances.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>Today we have on Paisley Nardini, she is Vice President and client portfolios strategist\nat Simplify asset management. We are diving right into their Simplify managed futures ETF, ticker, CTA, the pick to good\none there. But really interesting strategy, it plays four different signals to come up with the underlying\nactive asset allocation, it's done very well, specifically in times of volatility, but\nI will let Paisley tell the story.</p>\n<p>And I highlight that because a lot in managed futures broadly, you can really have access to all parts of the market equity for an exchange crypto now as well. We were very intentional at the launch of our strategies to provide our clients with the most capital efficient diversifier in the report fully looks at the end of the day. If you're pulling away from that 60 40 whether it be stocks or bonds or both. You really want to ensure that you're going to have a diversified source of risk and return.</p>\n<p>And I would say for anyone listening that might be concerned on that embedded leverage historically CTA has been around 12 to maybe 13 or 14% margin to equity so again our cap is 25% we are far below that. And all of the other so called like risk constraints that could be applied we don't have constraints beyond that 25% margin to equity ratio so what that means is we don't have sector caps we don't have position caps in that is very intentional as well because like any time you're taking active risk it's usually a very few subset of whether you're picking individual stocks or selecting futures contracts that are driving that alpha.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"So being able to understand the strategies from how they work, from a positioning perspective,\nthe impact of a market, and then having to articulate that work with clients, I think\nat the end of the day, is what's most fulfilling for me.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"We were very intentional at the launch of our strategies to provide our clients with the most capital efficient diversifier in the report fully looks at the end of the day.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Simplify launched in 2020 following a key SEC rule change that expanded the use of derivatives in ETFs.</li>\n<li>With negative correlation to equities and the potential for equity-like returns, CTA is increasingly being used as a key diversifier in modern model portfolios.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in quantitative investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Paisley Nardini highlights important considerations around fixed income.

    "content": "<p>In a recent special edition of Behind the Ticker recorded live at the Exchange ETF Conference, Matt Kaufman, Head of ETFs at Calamos Investments, joined the show to talk about Calamos\u2019 expanding lineup of structured outcome ETFs\u2014including their latest innovation: a suite of protected Bitcoin ETFs. With a legacy in risk-managed strategies, especially convertible bonds, Calamos has built a reputation over the past 50 years as a leader in delivering upside equity potential with downside protection, a philosophy that now extends to one of the most volatile asset classes\u2014Bitcoin.</p>\n<h2>About Matt Kaufman and Calamos</h2>\n<p>Kaufman introduced the firm\u2019s new structured protection Bitcoin ETFs: CBOJ (100% downside protection), CBTJ (10% at risk), and CBTX (20% at risk), offering varying degrees of risk-reward profiles depending on an investor\u2019s tolerance. These funds use a combination of zero-coupon U.S. Treasuries and option strategies built on a custom Bitcoin index developed with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). That index, tracking all 11 spot Bitcoin ETPs, enables Calamos to construct call spread strategies that allow for capped upside with predefined downside exposure\u2014offering investors a much-needed safety net in the crypto space.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>Kaufman explained how these ETFs are built: most of the portfolio is allocated to Treasuries to secure principal (e.g., 96% for the 100% protected product), while the remaining yield is used to buy a call spread on Bitcoin. The result is a defined one-year outcome period with options-based exposure to Bitcoin\u2019s price movement. Kaufman emphasized the appeal of these products during periods of high volatility, noting that current upside caps are as high as 50\u201360% for the 20% floor product\u2014making them attractive even amid Bitcoin\u2019s recent drawdown.</p>\n<p>Designed for both crypto-curious investors and advisors looking to include Bitcoin in client portfolios with risk control, the Calamos suite of protected Bitcoin ETFs fills a significant gap in the market. Whether used as a \u201crisk-off\u201d sleeve in a crypto model portfolio or as a bond-alternative with meaningful upside, these ETFs offer a more traditional framework for incorporating Bitcoin.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Matt Kaufman covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>We've a convert ETF that's performing very well. But we've launched a what I would call synthetic convertible strategy where we buy call options on stocks in the NASDAQ 100. And then we pick our own bonds. We've got an actively managed bond portfolio. That is one of if not my favorite ETF in our lineup. We've outperform the Qs since inception last year with less risk. So it's performing very well delivering exactly as we expected. And then the newer newest offering that we just brought to market was protected Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>You can get a 5% 9% 10% 15, 20, 30. Like there's every different opportunity for you to access the S&P in a way that works for you. And so you can see how the the universe of options and ETFs expands. The structured note marketplace has been around for three or four decades. And that really started to be disrupted in the ETF space around 2017. I was building some intellectual property that was doing buffers on the S&P 500.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So Matt Kaufman, I'm the head of ETFs at Calamose investments. For those not familiar with Calamose, Calamose is about a 50 year old risk manager, largely built on a foundation of convertible bonds. So if you're not familiar for those listening with a convertible bond, it combines a call option, you know, upside option of a company. And it ties it to its fixed income counterpart or its corporate bond. So what you end up with is the upside of a stock and good markets and then you've got a bond floor.</p>\n<p>But as we moved into ETFs, Calamose is now in the ETF space. We've been at it for about two years now. And we have a lot of risk management products, as you might expect. We built the world's first one year, 100% principle protected ETFs on the S&P 500, the Russell 2000, the NASDAQ 100. So I think you and I spoke about that about a year ago. You know, it had a lot of great reception on those. We've launched a few other ETFs into the market since then.</p>\n<p>Yeah, there's thousands of ETFs in the market. I remember 15 years ago when people would say is the market saturated and there were hundreds of ETFs in the market. And we just keep finding new areas of opportunity. And I always say it's a great time to be an investor, especially with ETFs in the market because you can now get. You get the S&P 500. And there's so many different derivative to use upon their derivative options that you can use to get exposure to the S&P 500 now.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"And the difference is 4% that 4% that you're collecting from your treasury bonds.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"So that's why I say this allows you to choose how much to put at risk.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Designed for both crypto-curious investors and advisors looking to include Bitcoin in client portfolios with risk control, the Calamos suite of protected Bitcoin ETFs fills a significant gap in the market.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in fixed income relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in crypto & digital assets relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Matt Kaufman highlights important considerations around risk management.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of Behind the Ticker, Jeff Cullen, Managing Director at Schafer Cullen Capital Management, sat down to discuss the firm\u2019s first ETF, the Cullen Enhanced Equity Income ETF (ticker: DIVP). With over 30 years in the asset management industry and experience across mutual funds, SMAs, and ETFs, Cullen provided a deep dive into how the firm\u2019s long-standing dividend-focused value strategy evolved into an actively managed ETF. Schafer Cullen, which manages over $24 billion in assets, has built a reputation over four decades as a value manager with a strong emphasis on dividend-paying stocks, and DIVP represents a natural extension of that philosophy.DIVP is a high-conviction, actively managed strategy that holds 30 to 40 large-cap, household-name value stocks with above-average dividend yields\u2014typically above 3%. What sets DIVP apart is its selective covered call overlay, where the team writes short-dated, out-of-the-money call options (typically 2\u20134% out and expiring in two weeks to one month) on about 25\u201340% of the portfolio. The calls are written on individual stocks, not an index, and are chosen based on market volatility and the underlying fundamental outlook of each holding. This approach allows the portfolio to enhance income without significantly capping upside potential, thanks to thoughtful partial-position writing and sector diversification.Cullen emphasized that the ETF is designed to deliver two sources of income\u2014dividends from quality value stocks and call option premiums\u2014leading to a historical yield between 7.2% and 8.3% in the SMA version of the strategy, with more than half of that coming from qualified dividend income. The strategy is intended for investors seeking higher income with equity market participation and downside resilience. While the ETF may underperform in sharp bull runs or during periods of low volatility, it performs particularly well in sideways or volatile markets where premium harvesting and dividend yield can shine.Cullen also shared his enthusiasm for entering the ETF space, highlighting the structural benefits of the ETF wrapper, including tax efficiency, ease of implementation, and the ability to reach a broader set of advisors and investors. He noted that Schafer Cullen plans to expand its ETF offerings, potentially via ETF share classes of existing mutual funds, depending on upcoming SEC rulings.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Jeff Cullen covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>And then we want to see is dividend growth and that particular stock coming from the earnings growth in a company. We don't want them to do fancy financial engineering and borrow debt in order to fuel a fund a dividend payment. We want that combination of three low PE dividend yield and dividend growth. So once though and then you want to diversify portfolio. Because if you're writing options on only two sectors, right? If your valuation brings you to owning say staples, utilities and energy,\nthen that means I have to write or the team has to write options only in those three options.</p>\n<p>So for example, we're not going to compare utility to a technology stock for PE ratios. It's going to be XYZ stocks. The historical PE ratio is 25 and right now it's trading at 18 with this market correction. And the dividend yield is now 3.4% or something like that. That becomes attractive to us. We want to see earnings growth from the company. We want to see expansion. We want to see reasons why the earnings are going to rise.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>And now they're getting access to some of these other\ncolumn income-producing ETFs\nthat can generate good yield for them. But I think they're starting to see\nthat there's actually underlying holdings\nthat could be volatile out in there. So for us, I think this works great for anyone\nthat needs income. And they are okay with some equity volatility\nfrom household, large cab value, dividend names. Because look at the breadth. These stocks are going to go down with it.</p>\n<p>We're going to look for a dividend yield probably greater than 3%. It's usually about 3% or higher we want a dividend yield. But we also want dividend growth, right? So we don't want to buy just low yielders and high dividend. I'm sorry low PE ratio stocks and high dividend yielders. You're going to wind up in just like utilities or some energy. What we look for is a combination of the three. We want lower PE stocks compared to their historical norm.</p>\n<p>There's a bit of a push toward\nconservative value investing\nfrom the go-go growth that's been on the Nasdaq\nand the S&P. And that creates a good blend. And the way I like it,\nis our firm is a value-oriented investment. So we manage non-cover-call option\nstrategies as well. And we're often used as a blend with\na growth manager for our financial advisors\nthat have used us for decades. And that's how we're reviewing the same thing. While many of the popular ETFs\nthat you cover call writing today,\nthey tend to be S&P 500-oriented\nor Nasdaq-oriented.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"The reality is the underlying names in the 30 to 40 stocks we own.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"And that's why writing one month options\ngives us that flexibility.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>With over 30 years in the asset management industry and experience across mutual funds, SMAs, and ETFs, Cullen provided a deep dive into how the firm\u2019s long-standing dividend-focused value strategy evolved into an actively managed ETF.</li>\n<li>What sets DIVP apart is its selective covered call overlay, where the team writes short-dated, out-of-the-money call options (typically 2\u20134% out and expiring in two weeks to one month) on about 25\u201340% of the portfolio.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in options strategies relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Jeff Cullen highlights important considerations around fixed income.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of Behind the Ticker, Dan Petersen, Head of Product Management at New York Life Investments, discussed the firm\u2019s international equity strategy and the mechanics behind the NYLI FTSE International Equity Currency Neutral ETF (ticker: HFXI). With over two decades in the industry, Petersen has held various roles in financial advisory and ETF distribution, playing a key role in the growth of IndexIQ before its acquisition by New York Life in 2015. Since then, he has focused on product development, helping expand the firm\u2019s ETF offerings.</p>\n<h2>About Dan Petersen and New York Life</h2>\n<p>HFXI was designed to provide a balanced approach to international investing by hedging 50% of currency exposure while maintaining full equity market exposure. Petersen explained that historically, investors in international equities had to accept full currency exposure by default, which could add or detract significantly from returns depending on currency fluctuations. Fully hedged products emerged to remove this risk entirely, but many investors found it difficult to time when to hedge and when not to. HFXI was created to offer a middle ground\u2014allowing investors to benefit from currency movements when favorable while reducing the risk of extreme fluctuations.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>The fund achieves this partial hedge by using forward contracts that are rolled monthly, adjusting for changes in currency valuations. Petersen highlighted that currency exposure can have a substantial impact on performance, often contributing or detracting by as much as 600 to 1,000 basis points annually. By hedging half the exposure, HFXI aims to smooth out volatility while still allowing investors to participate in foreign currency strength when it occurs. This strategy is particularly beneficial in periods of global economic stability when foreign currencies tend to appreciate, as well as in risk-off environments where excessive currency exposure can compound equity drawdowns.</p>\n<p>Petersen positioned HFXI as a long-term core allocation within international equity portfolios. Advisors can use it as a standalone replacement for unhedged international ETFs or pair it with traditional market-cap-weighted international funds to create a customized level of currency exposure. He also pointed out that international equities currently present a compelling valuation opportunity, with price-to-earnings ratios at historically attractive discounts compared to U.S. markets. Given the extreme valuation gap between U.S. and international stocks, he suggested that now may be an opportune time for investors to consider increasing international exposure.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Dan Petersen covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>There is a slightly positive correlation, but it is a separate distinct time series return because there are times where currencies correlate and times of currencies don't correlate but by and large when I reduce currency exposure in the portfolio it takes away volatility. So we look at this as a way to pair with active in order to lower your volatility and maybe come closer to a benchmark exposure, but maintain your active exposure as well. As a as a satellite or you know to whatever extent you want to maintain active and and definitely as a passive substitute and portfolios for international just again have maintaining your market cap weighted equity not tinkering with your equity waiting.</p>\n<p>Really, there wasn't a decision. If you were to go back if 20 years or so, you pretty much as accepted currency risk for what it was. And whether that helped or hurt, you understood that that was part of the attribution to the return. And then fully hedge products started to come out to. Deliver the option that you had the chance now to remove currency risk from the equation and just focus it on the equity exposure. And when those first came out, there was a lot going on in Japan to intentionally devalue the yen spur exports, the title that albidom expected.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>When I look back at performance, I see what has done well. But if currencies mean revert, I might not want to do what has done well. And it gets into a very deep rabbit hole of decision making that is impacted by just a tremendous number of different possibilities,\nwhether it be interest rates, geopolitical risks and things in that nature. Trying to provide almost the most passive approach which is market cap waiting and having the currency exposure.</p>\n<p>You know there are smart beta strategies and other ways to approach international to try to reduce volatility. But many times we find that sacrifice returns as well, so this is a way that you don't give up any equity exposure whatsoever, but you're able to reduce your volatility through currency reduction.</p>\n<p>And in our conversations for those that were around for that, we find that most people just do not want to do anything in terms of making a decision to have,\nto have not currency and they just go to default option. If you look at indices, all indices are US dollar based. So when you're benchmarking, you generally have the impact of currencies reflected in the benchmarks as well. We're trying to deliver an option here that lets people understand that there is a neutral way to do this to have some currency exposure.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"So why don't you start by giving us an overview and what makes this, you know, really unique product in the international equity space.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"So the instrument allows you to settle on the difference in the currencies from the beginning and month to the end of the month.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>With over two decades in the industry, Petersen has held various roles in financial advisory and ETF distribution, playing a key role in the growth of IndexIQ before its acquisition by New York Life in 2015.</li>\n<li>HFXI was designed to provide a balanced approach to international investing by hedging 50% of currency exposure while maintaining full equity market exposure.</li>\n<li>By hedging half the exposure, HFXI aims to smooth out volatility while still allowing investors to participate in foreign currency strength when it occurs.</li>\n<li>Petersen positioned HFXI as a long-term core allocation within international equity portfolios.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Dan Petersen highlights important considerations around portfolio construction.

With over a decade of experience at CNBC\u2014working on Squawk Box, covering markets from the floor of the NYSE with Bob Pisani, and helping launch ETF Edge\u2014Chang transitioned to VettaFi to further develop her own voice and contribute to the growing ETF landscape.</p>\n<h2>About Kirsten Chang and VettaFi</h2>\n<p>Chang explained that VettaFi is more than just the organizer of the Exchange conference. It serves as an index provider, a data analytics firm, and a digital distribution company focused on bridging the gap between advisors and ETF issuers. With over 4,000 ETFs available in the market, VettaFi helps investors and financial professionals sift through the noise by offering research, webcasts, and educational content. Through its partnerships with asset managers, the firm provides timely insights on ETF flows, market trends, and new product developments.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>The discussion then shifted to the Exchange ETF Conference, now taking place in Las Vegas after years in Miami. Chang highlighted that the conference is designed to offer advisors actionable insights and analysis, with sessions covering everything from private credit and hedge fund-led multi-asset ETFs to the explosive growth of active ETFs. The event brings together the biggest names in the industry, including keynote speakers like David Kelly and Ian Bremmer, and features panels on thematic investing, ESG trends, crypto, AI, and international equities. With record-breaking fixed income ETF flows and the continued rise of AI-related investments, the conference aims to provide a roadmap for advisors navigating today\u2019s markets.</p>\n<p>Chang also emphasized Exchange\u2019s focus on networking and community building, calling it the must-attend event for anyone in the ETF space. She shared details on new initiatives like the Putt for Pink charity event benefiting Susan G. Komen, a March Madness basketball connect-four game hosted by State Street, and an interactive app that allows attendees to schedule meetings and customize their experience.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Kirsten Chang covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>He just launched his new kind of bottom feeders ETF, the research deletion ETF last year. So lots of characters there will have state street, global advisors and bridge water. Things that gives from both heavy weights and the asset management industry. They'll be on stage with my colleague Todd Rosenblitz to delve into their brand new all weather\nETF that just launched yesterday. You know, it's the first ETF that really offers that hedge fund strategy to the average retail investor.</p>\n<p>So it'll be interesting to see what he's watching given thematics of kind of fall into the\nwayside over the past year or so. So we'll see if those pick up this year as more investors looked at Chase Alfa, which\nis also got an interesting international equity panel with three edge and research affiliates,\nwhich is a very timely topic in today's economic environment. Again, AI, Surging Power Demand, the crypto panel led by Eric Balchunes, Bloomberg, always\ngreat on those and that ESG session again.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>In terms of, I guess, other speakers, David Kelly, again, great, great speaker, chief global\nstrategist, something of a rock star now among our advisor audience. So we're going to go in and deep with one of the largest active managers in the space,\nhim and John Mayer of JP Morgan. Oh, and here's the fun. When we have one called Money Lines and Markets, where Mike Durso, from Shore Haven's\ngoing to talk to Mike Palm of circus sports, and they're kind of drawing the parallels\nbetween investing and sports betting, because there's a surprising amount of quantitative\nanalysis and strategy behind sports betting that can be applied to investing.</p>\n<p>Welcome to Beyond the ticker. Today we have on Kirsten Chang, she is from Vettify and we are talking about the exchange\nETF conference, which is right around the corner. It is the big one, 23rd, 24th, 25th and 26th of March. We will be in Vegas this year, everybody in the ETF industry, the whole landscape, as\nwell as hundreds and hundreds of financial advisors, there is plenty to do.</p>\n<p>So whatever resonated at the conference was really what to rove, investor, and advisor\ninterest for the rest of the year. So I was always very fascinated by that community. I think I've started my day off for the last 20 years with Squawk Box.</p>\n<p>And you know, speaking of new launches, lots of buzz again around the new private credit ETFs. Quite a few eyebrows raised there. So we'll hit on this when we talk fixed income with bond blocks and FM investments. Those are two big innovators in the bond ETF space. And you know, fixed income, again, top of mind for many after a record year for fixed income ETF\nflows. Then we also also got my colleague Roxanna Islam, just going to be talking about under the radar\nthematic tech trends with an active portfolio manager at TRO.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"So we're bringing all the biggest issuers and asset management provide, you know, they're\nthere, they're part of our partnership.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"Because I think that's the real importance of that, of that community, ever, ever vessance\nand kind of feeding off the energy that you get when you're in person with all these\npeople.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Through its partnerships with asset managers, the firm provides timely insights on ETF flows, market trends, and new product developments.</li>\n<li>Chang highlighted that the conference is designed to offer advisors actionable insights and analysis, with sessions covering everything from private credit and hedge fund-led multi-asset ETFs to the explosive growth of active ETFs.</li>\n<li>The event brings together the biggest names in the industry, including keynote speakers like David Kelly and Ian Bremmer, and features panels on thematic investing, ESG trends, crypto, AI, and international equities.</li>\n<li>With record-breaking fixed income ETF flows and the continued rise of AI-related investments, the conference aims to provide a roadmap for advisors navigating today\u2019s markets.</li>\n<li>Komen, a March Madness basketball connect-four game hosted by State Street, and an interactive app that allows attendees to schedule meetings and customize their experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Kirsten Chang highlights important considerations around income investing.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of Behind the Ticker, Adam Patti, founder and CEO of VistaShares, discussed the launch of the VistaShares Artificial Intelligence Supercycle ETF (ticker: AIS) and how it differentiates itself in the growing AI investment space. With over two decades in the ETF industry, Patti previously founded IndexIQ, one of the earliest issuers of liquid alternative ETFs, which was later acquired by New York Life. After spending several years outside the industry, Patti partnered with John McNeil of DVX Ventures to launch VistaShares, focusing on building high-quality thematic ETFs with a more thoughtful and targeted approach.Patti explained that AIS is designed to provide pure exposure to the AI supercycle by focusing exclusively on the infrastructure driving artificial intelligence, particularly in data centers and semiconductors. Unlike many AI-themed ETFs that hold broad tech exposure dominated by the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, AIS takes a supply chain-driven approach, investing in companies that manufacture the essential components\u2014such as GPUs, VRAMs, cooling systems, and fiber optic networks\u2014needed to power AI. By analyzing the bill of materials for AI data centers and semiconductors, VistaShares identifies companies with substantial AI-driven revenue, ensuring that the fund is directly tied to AI growth rather than being diluted by large-cap tech names with only partial AI exposure.AIS follows a rules-based, actively managed strategy that combines systematic supply chain analysis with an active overlay. The core portfolio is constructed based on a transparent, rules-driven methodology\u2014one that VistaShares has filed for a patent on\u2014ensuring that holdings are determined by their relevance to AI infrastructure rather than arbitrary weightings. The fund undergoes a semi-annual rebalance, but Patti emphasized that the active overlay allows for adjustments in response to new developments in the rapidly evolving AI space. The investment committee, which includes AI industry practitioners such as former Tesla president John McNeil and AI entrepreneur Sonny Madra, helps identify emerging trends, new players, and risks within the AI ecosystem before they become widely recognized.Patti also highlighted the global nature of the AI supply chain, with AIS holding companies from the U.S., Taiwan, China, and Europe. Currently, about 60% of the portfolio is U.S.-based, with the remainder distributed across key AI manufacturing hubs. Looking ahead, VistaShares has the flexibility to expand the portfolio\u2019s focus, potentially incorporating consumer-facing AI applications and energy solutions as the industry matures. However, for now, the fund remains centered on AI infrastructure, which Patti believes is still in the early stages of exponential growth, as evidenced by record-breaking capital expenditures from major tech firms.For investors and advisors looking to incorporate AIS into portfolios, Patti suggested a 3-5% allocation within a core equity strategy, positioning it as a high-conviction growth satellite.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Adam Patti covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>I was way back in the early days of the ETF market. But they gave me the first taste of the market and the growth prospects and how interesting the ETF wrapper was for investors and how efficient it is to use it portfolio. So fast forward, I ended up taking that knowledge and founding a company in 2006 called Index IQ. We were one of the early ETF issuers. I think we were the 18th or so that launched. And we focused on liquid alternatives trying to package institutional quality alternative investment strategies in the ETF wrapper.</p>\n<p>You know, we won't be we're not going to make active trades for the sake of being active. We're going to do it if we think there's a significant risk or opportunity that needs to be addressed. So speaking about like geographic exposure. Or is this go anywhere you evaluating opportunities in emerging markets outside of the U.S. or is it pretty much just domestic? There's companies all the world that are providing significant innovation into the space. About 60% of the portfolio is currently a U.S.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So before we get started, wanting to take a little bit of time and tell everybody a little bit about your background and how you ended up founding VistaShares. Sure, I've been in the ETF market dating back way back to around 2001 where I was running. Among other things, a division over a time warner called Fortune Index is where we created a stock index based on the Fortune 500. We used that index to create an ETF with state street, the triple F was a ticker.</p>\n<p>So let's say in the cooling system, there's a hundred million dollars in AI. AI data center projects and there's four companies in each in that that are that have met our criteria. And one of those companies has 50 million of the hundred million. We are market share weight them within the, within the segment. So the company that has 50 of the hundred million will get 50% of the 25%\nAnd the other countries will split the remaining based on based on how much revenue they're bringing to the table.</p>\n<p>The other piece is the energy piece. That's another piece that we have the flexibility to bring in as well. Once that gets to the point where it's more investable and a little more mature. So you would mention, which I agree with you, a lot of these AI centered focused ETFs right now are heavily weighted and the video Microsoft, you guys are much more diversified in terms of underlying holdings. I believe it last look and don't quote me on this, there's, you know, some like 72 companies across various segments of the supply chain.</p>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In a recent episode of Behind the Ticker, Adam Patti, founder and CEO of VistaShares, discussed the launch of the VistaShares Artificial Intelligence Supercycle ETF (ticker: AIS) and how it differentiates itself in the growing AI investment space.</li>\n<li>The fund undergoes a semi-annual rebalance, but Patti emphasized that the active overlay allows for adjustments in response to new developments in the rapidly evolving AI space.</li>\n<li>Currently, about 60% of the portfolio is U.S.-based, with the remainder distributed across key AI manufacturing hubs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Adam Patti highlights important considerations around growth investing.

    "content": "<p>n a recent episode of Behind the Ticker, Emma Harper, a research analyst at Sage Advisory, shared insights from the firm\u2019s 2024 ETF Stewardship Report, which evaluates how ETF providers engage with companies, vote on shareholder proposals, and integrate sustainability and governance practices. With a background in finance and research, Harper plays a key role in Sage's analysis of responsible investment strategies, ensuring the firm\u2019s investment decisions align with best stewardship practices. Sage Advisory, which manages approximately $28 billion in assets, focuses on institutional and retail clients, blending investment management with rigorous research.Harper explained that Sage\u2019s annual stewardship report examines ETF providers' voting and engagement practices, governance structures, and transparency efforts. The report analyzes how asset managers influence corporate behavior through proxy voting, engagement strategies, and sustainability considerations. One key aspect of the research is assessing whether providers have dedicated stewardship teams and clearly defined voting policies. Given that ETF holders delegate their ownership rights to fund issuers, understanding how these rights are exercised is crucial for fiduciary responsibility.A major trend identified in the 2024 report is a decline in transparency among ETF providers, particularly in response to regulatory scrutiny and political pressures. Harper noted that while early versions of the report saw growing disclosures from asset managers, recent years have shown a more cautious, legalistic approach to describing stewardship activities. Additionally, there is a widening divide between active and passive ETF managers, with active managers generally exhibiting stronger stewardship practices. Passive managers, on the other hand, tend to rely more on third-party proxy advisors and have less direct engagement with portfolio companies.Harper also highlighted concerns about the concentration of voting power among a few major ETF providers, such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. These firms control trillions of dollars in assets and exercise substantial influence over corporate governance. The report found that larger providers tend to support management more often than smaller firms, which raises questions about their commitment to shareholder advocacy. Harper emphasized that investors should carefully evaluate ETF issuers\u2019 stewardship policies, particularly as issues like ESG, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity become more relevant in corporate decision-making.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Emma Harper covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>And so if you know ETF providers don't exercise their stewardship responsibilities diligently we think there's a risk in harming long term value and exacerbating broader market risks like corporate governance failures or. And it grants to other researchers like really risks and from our data. Actually the larger managers are far more likely to support management than vote against management and through self reported stats we found that large managers on average reported supporting management about 91% of the time versus media managers or small managers the groups that we have reporting more 81 82% of the time.</p>\n<p>And so they have products that are catering to those investors looking for ETFs that align with their particular priorities. But overall as fiduciaries they have to prioritize the long-term financial interest of their clients. I would agree with that. Engagement with portfolio companies I think is probably one of the key elements of stewardship. What differences do you notice in engagement strategies among different ETF providers and even by size.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So I would say you can try to do some on ETF providers very right some don't even engage right so we're talking about that passive group where they just. They just don't engage at all that's not part of their strategy that's not something they do so that's one group. And and then you have another group that are really focused on engaging really have a focus on topic talking with company management. Having metrics and targets for success for their conversations.</p>\n<p>And I have been focused on research and sage. So all things research on things like ETFs I were chatting about today to responsible investment, sustainable strategies. So it's been really interesting to see kind of the growth of all these different areas and be able to learn about all these different ETF providers. And there are their stewardship practices is going to be focused for us and what we're chatting about today. So it's been it's been a journey and it's been great to learn.</p>\n<p>So before we get started, I want to give everybody a little bit about your background and how you eventually ended up over at Sage Advisory. Sure, so I went back to school after having career in actually a different world. It was more retail management. And I decided to go back to school because I loved the financial aspects of the business and everything. And so I went and bought my MBA and focused in finance and then wound funding a job with a few.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"There actually might be a difference in stewardship practices and what we found was actually a pretty good gap in stewardship practices between those that were more.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"Right, we wanted we wanted want to make sure we understand what's happened in practices with that as well as overall so that's why we we focus on both and you know overall search practices as well as ENS practices to understand.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>With a background in finance and research, Harper plays a key role in Sage's analysis of responsible investment strategies, ensuring the firm\u2019s investment decisions align with best stewardship practices.</li>\n<li>One key aspect of the research is assessing whether providers have dedicated stewardship teams and clearly defined voting policies.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in active management relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Emma Harper highlights important considerations around active management.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of Behind the Ticker, Rob Arnott, founder and chairman of Research Affiliates, shared insights into the firm's latest innovation, the Research Affiliates Deletions ETF (ticker: NIXT). With nearly 50 years in investment management, Arnott has built a reputation for pioneering quantitative investing strategies, particularly through the development of the Fundamental Index methodology. Research Affiliates, founded in 2002, now indirectly oversees $158 billion in assets through partnerships with firms like Schwab, Invesco, and PIMCO.Arnott explained that NIXT was created to exploit inefficiencies in traditional market-cap-weighted indexes. When companies are removed from major indices like the S&P 500 or Russell 1000, they often experience exaggerated price declines, pushing them to deep value levels. Historically, these \"deleted\" stocks tend to recover significantly, often outperforming the market in the years following their removal. NIXT systematically captures this mean reversion by identifying and investing in stocks that have been dropped from indices due to temporary underperformance rather than fundamental deterioration.The fund follows a rules-based process where deletions from the top 500 and top 1,000 market cap rankings are screened for quality metrics, eliminating the bottom 20% to avoid value traps. The remaining stocks are then held in equal weight for five years, allowing time for revaluation and recovery. Arnott noted that this approach benefits from both the structural inefficiencies of index deletions and the broader opportunity in small-cap and deep value stocks, which are currently trading at historically low relative valuations.Arnott positioned NIXT as a unique completion strategy, complementing traditional market-cap-weighted portfolios by reintroducing stocks that indices have discarded too soon. While not intended as a core allocation, NIXT provides an alternative way for investors to gain small-cap value exposure with a systematic, contrarian approach.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Rob Arnott covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>It's that the mere process of adding a stock just because it's market cap is sort,\ndeleting a stock just because it's market cap is tanked. Is that process in and of itself is the problem. And so what we do is when a stock falls out of the top 50 or out of the top 1100,\nit's on our deletions list. Now what we've noticed is that deletions outperform the market by an average of 7% per year,\nthe first couple of years tapering off to about 3% after 5 years,\ntotal of 28% 2800 basis points about performance over the 5 years after deletion.</p>\n<p>Today we have on Rob our know he is the founder of research affiliates. And we are very pleased to have him. He's got over 50 years of investment management experience,\nparticularly pioneering qualitative or quantitative excuse me, investment strategies and really coming up with index methodology\nfor a ton of different strategies. You are probably very familiar with but today we're talking in detail about the next\nor NIXT which is the research affiliates deletion ETF.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>We're best known for our work in global multi asset strategies. Global tech to class at allocation. We run the PIMCO all asset product suite. And M4 developing quantitative equity strategies,\nnotably fundamental index on a million taxes over a hundred of our hundreds,\n56 billion. And the notion with fundamental index is quite simply why should we\nchoose stocks for our index based on how popular and expensive they are,\nwhich is what happens with cap waiting. And why should we wait stocks that way?</p>\n<p>And there's a lot of curve fitting and optimization going on. And we know over time that, you know, you might have a short window of alpha\nperformance, but that's likely not to be the case,\nspecifically for someone who's had a long track record,\nlike you guys ever. Yeah, we've had the fundamental indexes now 20 years old. And it's performance relative to the market hinges on how value is doing. So if value is doing well, we have a tailwind\nto values struggling, we have a headwind, but we beat value by enough\nthat our 20-year results are ahead of the broad market,\neven though value is 3,000 basis points behind the market.</p>\n<p>Value's been tough for anybody invested in values over the last\nG's 36 months, it seems. Well, and you can go back 15 years. It's really since 2007 is when value peaked relative to growth\nand some of the 2020 is when it hit bottom. But it's been bottom bouncing since then. Right now, it's not too far off of the 2020 lows\nin terms of the relative cheapness of value relative to growth. If you look at price to book value, value was one third\nas expensive as growth in 2007.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"In Vesco, pro shares,\nSchwab, Schwab is the biggest relationship and pin cope.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"Well, that's why buy high and sell low again and again\nwhen the size of the business was moving up and down a little bit\nand the size of the market cap was plunging and crashing.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>While not intended as a core allocation, NIXT provides an alternative way for investors to gain small-cap value exposure with a systematic, contrarian approach.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in growth investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in portfolio construction relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Rob Arnott highlights important considerations around quantitative investing.

    "content": "<p>n a recent episode of Behind the Ticker, John Davi, founder and CIO of Astoria Advisors, discussed the firm's latest ETF launch, the Astoria US Quality Kings ETF (ticker: GQQQ). With over two decades of experience in quantitative investing and asset allocation, Davi founded Astoria in 2017, building a firm focused on macro-driven and quantitative investment strategies. Managing approximately $2 billion in assets, Astoria serves financial advisors, institutions, and ultra-high-net-worth individuals.Davi explained that GQQQ was created to address a gap in the growth investing space. While many existing growth ETFs are purely market-cap weighted, GQQQ combines growth with a quality filter, ensuring exposure to high-growth companies while maintaining fundamental financial strength. Unlike broad Nasdaq-based ETFs, which include all non-financial large-cap stocks without quality screening, GQQQ applies quantitative selection criteria focusing on return on equity (ROE), return on assets (ROA), and return on invested capital (ROIC). This results in a portfolio that captures growth opportunities while reducing exposure to weaker companies.The ETF blends large-cap and mid-cap stocks, aiming to identify the next generation of market leaders. Davi highlighted AppLovin as an example\u2014GQQQ included the stock in its launch portfolio in October 2023, months before it was added to the Nasdaq 100, allowing early participation in its strong performance. By including mid-cap growth names, GQQQ seeks to capitalize on emerging winners while mitigating the concentration risks seen in traditional growth ETFs dominated by the \"Magnificent Seven\" mega-cap tech stocks.Davi also emphasized the risk management strategies within GQQQ. The ETF undergoes an annual rebalance with quarterly quantitative reviews, allowing for adjustments when stocks significantly de-rank in quality metrics. While not a adaptive allocation product, this process ensures that the fund remains aligned with its quality-growth mandate. He positioned GQQQ as a complementary holding to existing growth ETFs like QQQ or Vanguard's growth ETFs, offering a more refined and risk-conscious approach to growth investing.For advisors and investors looking to incorporate GQQQ into their portfolios, Davi suggested it as a way to diversify traditional growth exposure, especially given the heavy concentration in a few stocks within broad-market growth indices.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and John Davi covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>So it can go into midcap. Makes an interesting case of finding some quality in value with their screening process. And might have a little bit of different names in flavor, ultimately trying to offer growth. Also lower some risk because the multiple is going to be a little bit lower than what you're seeing on the Nasdaq. And ultimately the goal is to increase the sharp ratio as well.</p>\n<p>So our tech sector weight, you're going to be very similar to,\nI mean, it's going to be in between spies and cues. So it's like 45% tech, 14% communication,\nand then communication services,\nand the continuous session is 13%. But the difference would be that we may have stocks that are lower in market capital\ncompared to like spies and cues. Based on a sense to me. So I was actually, I was, I had the, the pleasure of being on Schwab network\nthis morning, actually, after, well, I'm waiting to get on.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>But in our state of goal,\nin our multi-ass portfolios is to get,\nlike, 150 basis points to 100 above bench. And, you know, we've had good returns and historically,\nand our SMAs. And even if you look at, like,\nPPI, the first ETF we launched,\nyou know, it's in the second percentile over the last three years\nat, like, 330 funds in our category. Even our other ETF, R-O-E,\nlast year was its first full count on the year,\nand it was in the 12 percentile out of, like, 1100 funds.</p>\n<p>I've been watching your growth. Specifically in those two ETFs that you launched first. So congratulations on all your success. And you have recently launched a new ETF, which is why you're here. So can you tell me, you know, what really inspired the creation of GQQQ? I'm going to call it GQs. And what gap in the market you're looking to fill there.</p>\n<p>So, you've mentioned tech a few times. So does G triple Q's have other sector diversification in it,\nor is it mean, or is it pretty much just focused on on the tech sector,\nor are you, are there other sectors that you're playing in? And do you have any guardrails on that sector exposure, or you just leave it down to the process? Okay, so that we try and take the midpoint between spies and cues. And we want this thing to kind of, it's the goal.</p>\n<p>Today we have on John Dovey from Astoria Advisors. He's a frequent recurring guest on this show and today we're talking about their third listing GQQQQ\nor C calls that the G triple Q's or as I'm calling it the GQ's. We'll work it out, you guys will figure out what you want to call it. But anyways, it is the Astoria U.S. They're trying to find more of those quality names inside of growth, not just in the Nasdaq 100 in large cap growth.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"But the difference would be that we may have stocks that are lower in market capital\ncompared to like spies and cues.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"So, you know, we'll talk about,\nyou know, I want to kind of talk about this\nin terms of the difference between GQs\nand triple cues and, you know,\njust passive ETFs.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>While many existing growth ETFs are purely market-cap weighted, GQQQ combines growth with a quality filter, ensuring exposure to high-growth companies while maintaining fundamental financial strength.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in portfolio construction relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in risk management relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with John Davi highlights important considerations around quantitative investing.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of Behind the Ticker, Mike Loukas, CEO of TrueShares, shared insights into the firm\u2019s journey and the unique approach behind their ETFs, including their latest launches, QBUL and QBER. Loukas, with over 30 years of experience in the financial industry, founded TrueMark Investments in 2019 with the purpose of establishing TrueShares as a solutions-based ETF platform. TrueShares aims to take traditional active strategies and institutional hedging techniques and incorporate them into ETFs that offer investors smarter portfolio construction tools.</p>\n<h2>About Mike Loukas and TrueShares</h2>\n<p>Loukas explained that TrueShares\u2019 ETF lineup started with fundamental active management products and expanded to include thematic and structured outcome ETFs. Their defined outcome or buffered ETFs have been popular among investors seeking downside protection while maintaining exposure to equity growth. Most recently, the firm launched QBUL and QBER, two quarterly resetting hedged equity ETFs designed to offer principal protection with directional market exposure.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>QBUL aims to capture market gains beyond a 5% threshold within a quarter while maintaining treasury-level downside protection. In contrast, QBER generates positive returns when the market drops by more than 5%. Both funds use a structure where principal is invested in treasuries, and the yield is used to purchase out-of-the-money call options (for QBUL) or put options (for QBER). This approach ensures low risk exposure with the potential for asymmetric returns based on market movements.</p>\n<p>Loukas highlighted the flexibility of these ETFs within a portfolio, explaining that they can be used as standalone investments or blended with other asset classes to create diversified, risk-adjusted strategies. Advisors can use QBUL in bullish markets to enhance upside potential while maintaining principal security, and QBER in bearish markets to hedge against significant declines without taking on the risks associated with shorting the market.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Mike Loukas covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>On the other\ndirection to bear, same concept, you know, if the market drops more than five percent and a three\nmonth period, you will start to generate a positive return from cue bear in that band between\nplus five and negative five for the two strategies, your flat, your treasury. So it's, it's really\na more versatile tool, I think, then what we typically see out there, it's meant to allow\nsomeone constructing a portfolio to blend it with offered ETFs, blend it with long-only\nequity exposure, blend it with cash.</p>\n<p>So if you look at our structured outcome product lines, if you look at offer ETFs in general,\nright, particularly the equity-based ones, you have a thought process behind them is people still\nwant exposure to directional market moves. They still want exposure to the growth characteristics\nof large gap equities, for example. But they want to mitigate the downside and they're willing\nto give up some of that upside potential for downside mitigation. And so those are great, you know,\nwe have a series of neural lots out there.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So cue ball, it would be\nlook, if you've got a market move that's north of five percent in a quarter, then cue ball kicks in. And your downside is that of holding a treasury. So you've got this opportunity to say,\nlike, I have this risk tolerance. If the market\nbooms in a quarter, which historically it does a heck of a lot more often than we think,\nI want to be able to participate in some of that, but I can't take on the risk.</p>\n<p>And it comes down to conviction on market direction, right? So, if you're\nsurely establishing a risk tolerance, and you've got a 64 year or some other asset allocation,\nthat is meant to be an all-weather portfolio, you own both. You want a little bit in both,\nbecause what you're doing is you're, you're covering both tails. And if the market's up, it's going\nto magnify your right tail.</p>\n<p>We have an AI and deep learning product that's been out there since 2020. Pretty concentrated, long only 20 names, 21 names in the portfolio.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of Behind the Ticker, Catherine LeGraw, asset allocation strategist at GMO, shared insights into the firm\u2019s approach to value investing and their newly launched ETFs, including GMOV, their U.S. value ETF. LeGraw, who joined GMO in 2013 after working at BlackRock and Barclays Global Investors, brings a top-down perspective to asset allocation, seeking valuation-driven opportunities across asset classes. She emphasized GMO\u2019s commitment to long-term value investing and its employee-owned structure, which allows the firm to focus solely on clients\u2019 best interests.</p>\n<h2>About Catherine LeGraw and GMO</h2>\n<p>LeGraw explained that GMOV stands out among value-focused ETFs due to three key differentiators. First, GMO takes a top-down approach, looking for entire groups of dislocated or misvalued stocks, rather than relying solely on bottom-up stock selection. Currently, the fund focuses on the cheapest 20% of the market, which GMO believes represents a tremendous opportunity for deep value investing. Second, the firm does not rely on standard accounting data but instead restates financials to reflect true underlying value, such as treating research and development expenses as investments rather than operating costs. Lastly, GMO incorporates forward-looking projections tailored to each company\u2019s unique characteristics, providing a more accurate estimate of future profitability.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>GMOV also applies rigorous portfolio construction techniques to balance deep value opportunities with quality and growth characteristics, avoiding common value traps. LeGraw highlighted GMO\u2019s use of proprietary red flag screening, which examines accounting metrics, management behavior, and market signals to identify potential risks. The fund consists of approximately 150 names, with sector weightings determined by valuation attractiveness rather than traditional market cap constraints. Unlike many passive value ETFs that may be overweight in sectors like utilities, GMO\u2019s active approach allows them to avoid sectors they consider overvalued.</p>\n<p>In addition to discussing the U.S. market, LeGraw also touched on GMOI, their international value ETF, which she believes offers an even greater opportunity given the relative cheapness of international equities and the potential tailwind of currency valuation shifts. She emphasized that value investing is currently priced for significant outperformance, with deep value trading at historically attractive levels.</p>\n<h2>Portfolio Construction and Implementation</h2>\n<p>For advisors and investors looking to diversify their portfolios away from an overconcentration in U.S. large-cap growth, LeGraw suggests GMOV and GMOI as substitutes for passive value exposure or as adaptive allocations to capitalize on the current value opportunity.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Catherine LeGraw covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>So we're not holding\nanything in the portfolio that we think is expensive just for risk control. So I was going to ask a question on the role of sentiment and some other things and not getting\nstuck in a value trap. I think you did a great job already answering that. So I'm going to skip ahead\nand I want to we have been in a long period of relative underperformance of value versus growth. I mean, even in our funds that we run, we run everything equal weight and market cap is just\nis run right over us.</p>\n<p>When you think about the sources of relative return for a value investor, compared to the market\nor compared to the growth, value stocks always fundamentally undergrowth. By definition,\nthese stocks are trading at a discount for a good reason. They always outmeal the market. They have\nhigher yields than the average stock or then growth stocks. But the big source of relative return,\nthe big source of positive return for a value investor is this re-balancing.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So I think a lot of model portfolios out there have drifted from model and I've\ngotten pretty top heavy U.S. growth and specifically market capital weighted growth. So\nstaying on value and you'd mention passive. So in your view, why do passive approaches\nto value investing kind of fail to capture true economic value? Like, why GMOV over not to\nput any competitors out there was the first one, like a VTV, right? Just by value passively,\nwhat do you think an active approach to this is going to yield better opportunity going forward?</p>\n<p>So we have investment teams focus on asset allocation. In addition to dedicated teams focused on equity rates, credit, and hedge funds. So I'd say basically everything in liquid assets. We do for our clients and it's the full structure. We have some active ready to go strategies. The clients will just select and say, hey, that's a good fit for my portfolio. We also partner with our a lot of our clients. The it institutions like foundations,\ndiamonds, pension funds, wealth management firms.</p>\n<p>So one example there would\nbe financials. We have a lot of financials exposure in GMOV and we think we can find a lot of\nbanks and financial companies that are genuinely cheap trading and attractive valuations relative\nto their underlying fundamentals. However, on the other hand, most value approaches value indexes\nand many other value strategies will be overweight something like utilities. That's something\nwe're currently in GMOV. We have no exposure to utilities. Even though it's typically an overweight\nand value portfolios, if we're not finding companies that meet our definition of cheap,\nwe're just not going to hold the sector at all.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"Yeah, I think there are three things that are really differentiated in our approach to capturing\nvalue in GMO V.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"Value has been no fundamentally\nworse over this package decade than it was historically.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>She emphasized GMO\u2019s commitment to long-term value investing and its employee-owned structure, which allows the firm to focus solely on clients\u2019 best interests.</li>\n<li>LeGraw explained that GMOV stands out among value-focused ETFs due to three key differentiators.</li>\n<li>Currently, the fund focuses on the cheapest 20% of the market, which GMO believes represents a tremendous opportunity for deep value investing.</li>\n<li>Lastly, GMO incorporates forward-looking projections tailored to each company\u2019s unique characteristics, providing a more accurate estimate of future profitability.</li>\n<li>Unlike many passive value ETFs that may be overweight in sectors like utilities, GMO\u2019s active approach allows them to avoid sectors they consider overvalued.</li>\n<li>market, LeGraw also touched on GMOI, their international value ETF, which she believes offers an even greater opportunity given the relative cheapness of international equities and the potential tailwind of currency valuation shifts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Catherine LeGraw highlights important considerations around portfolio construction.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of Behind the Ticker, Kevin Carter, founder of EMQQ Global, shared his journey into investment management and the inspiration behind his suite of emerging market internet ETFs, including INQQ, which focuses on India\u2019s rapidly growing internet sector. With a background that began at Robertson Stephens in 1992 and included pioneering direct indexing and active indexing, Carter\u2019s passion for emerging markets and digital transformation culminated in the creation of EMQQ Global and its targeted ETF offerings.</p>\n<h2>About Kevin Carter and EMQQ Global</h2>\n<p>Carter discussed the investment thesis for INQQ, highlighting India\u2019s unique position as the world\u2019s largest and fastest-growing emerging market. With a population exceeding 1.4 billion, robust demographics, and a booming middle class, India presents unparalleled opportunities for consumption-driven growth. Carter emphasized India\u2019s ongoing infrastructure and technological advancements under Prime Minister Modi, particularly the \u201cIndia Stack,\u201d a revolutionary digital public infrastructure. The stack has transformed India\u2019s economy by enabling biometric identification, digital payments, and financial inclusion for over 800 million people in just a few years.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>INQQ provides investors exposure to the burgeoning internet sector in India, which Carter described as being in its early stages of growth. The ETF focuses on publicly traded Indian internet companies that meet market cap and liquidity thresholds, offering a diversified portfolio across various verticals, including e-commerce, payments, and online travel. Companies like Paytm and MakeMyTrip exemplify the opportunities available as digital adoption accelerates, with many sectors still in the nascent stages of development.</p>\n<p>Carter underscored the importance of INQQ as a standalone investment opportunity within emerging markets, appealing to those seeking targeted exposure to India\u2019s digital transformation.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Kevin Carter covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>We are glad to be back for 2025 and we start the year off with a great guest, Kevin Carter. He is the founder of EMQQ Global and we are talking about their Indian Internet ETF. The vast majority of this episode is Kevin going through how the Indian economy is the perfect emerging market, how they've structured all of their what he calls the stack to enable a really tech forward society. So for just education purposes but also for really what I believe after listening to Kevin a great investment opportunity, I think you're really going to enjoy this episode.</p>\n<p>John Bogel did and started Vanguard. So I started by reading about indexing and efficient markets. But I quickly became an Omaha person when it comes to thinking about investing. And what happened was in 1999 I had my own idea for a better way brokerage so you could buy five dollars of a stock or ten dollars of a stock. And I developed a system filed a patent on it and built a company called the E Investing which we sold to each trade in the year 2000.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>And then India has one other part of the story that nobody really knows I mean that a begging a black and white obviously a lot of you'll know about it but but for my experience most investors 99% of them. They have no idea about this next part which is called the India stack and it is I think a cheap code if you will or a secret weapon that that no other country has that that really sets the country apart.</p>\n<p>And this is making your own custom S&P 500 strategy where you own the stocks directly and can customize and lost harvest and so forth. But what happened was we sold that company active index advisors to the Texas asset management at the very end of 2004. But just before that Google went public and when they did that they asked my partner Bert to give a talk to the employees about investing. And I wasn't invited but a few months later a person from Google called me and said they wanted to you know invest with us.</p>\n<p>And it's really a big percentage of the world lives in emerging markets they have better demographics there are a lot younger than the developed countries. And that's driving a booming consumption which again it that is the thing that's emerging and if that's the list of why you're investing in emerging markets. It's really a question India is definitely perfect or at least it's as good as you can get because it not only has a large population it has the largest population in the world.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"I believe out China India is bigger than every other emerging market combined so number two would be Indonesia so it's the biggest five far and it can't really there really won't be another country with this population and any of our lifetimes.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"It has about 750 million people under the age of 30 so twice as many people twice as many young people as we have population so it's the biggest ever the youngest ever.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Carter discussed the investment thesis for INQQ, highlighting India\u2019s unique position as the world\u2019s largest and fastest-growing emerging market.</li>\n<li>INQQ provides investors exposure to the burgeoning internet sector in India, which Carter described as being in its early stages of growth.</li>\n<li>The ETF focuses on publicly traded Indian internet companies that meet market cap and liquidity thresholds, offering a diversified portfolio across various verticals, including e-commerce, payments, and online travel.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Kevin Carter highlights important considerations around etf industry.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of Behind the Ticker, David Dziekanski, founder and CEO of Quantify Funds, introduced his firm\u2019s first ETF, the STKD Bitcoin and Gold ETF (ticker: BTGD). With 17 years of experience in the investment and ETF industry, including 11 years as a partner at Tidal Financial Group, Dziekanski launched Quantify Funds to bring innovative, efficient investment solutions to market. BTGD represents a novel approach to leverage ETFs, offering exposure to both Bitcoin and gold in a single investment vehicle.</p>\n<h2>About David Dziekanski- Quantify Funds</h2>\n<p>BTGD is structured as a \u201cstacked\u201d ETF, providing $1 of exposure to Bitcoin and $1 of exposure to gold for every $1 invested. This 50-50 blend offers a leveraged, long-term approach without the typical path dependency or decay associated with traditional leverage products. The fund utilizes a combination of futures and exchange-traded products to optimize leverage and manage rebalancing efficiently. Dziekanski explained that the fund targets a 5-7% rebalance drift to minimize trading costs while maintaining the desired asset allocation.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>The rationale behind combining Bitcoin and gold lies in their shared status as scarcity assets. Gold, with its historical role as a store of value, and Bitcoin, often referred to as \u201cdigital gold,\u201d both offer protection against currency debasement. Dziekanski noted that the mining rates of Bitcoin (0.86% annually) and gold (1.75% annually) are significantly lower than the 7-9% annual currency printing rates of developed nations, making them ideal assets for a hedge against inflation and declining currency values.</p>\n<p>Dziekanski also highlighted how the differing volatility and correlations of Bitcoin and gold enhance the portfolio\u2019s resilience. Bitcoin\u2019s higher volatility is balanced by gold\u2019s stability, allowing for effective rebalancing during market shifts. Historical data shows that gold has performed well during past crypto winters, providing diversification benefits and mitigating drawdowns. Advisors are encouraged to view BTGD as a debasement hedge or a high-volatility alternative in portfolios, with suggested allocations ranging from 2-5%.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and David Dziekanski- Quantify Funds covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>And yes, the whole advisory space is going to need to catch up on performance tools and comparison tools to start. Incorporating some of these new stack products, these we think are really some of the first tools that are really acceptable in advisor models. These unlike the daily use leverage ETFs don't come with warnings of daily use. They should be much less of a compliance nightmare in advisors models, but the second you have an advisor who through underlying ETF starts managing a portfolio that is 110% overall exposure.</p>\n<p>Across your entire model allocation that was don't believe that was meant just for an aggressive growth portfolio. I think that's actually the most alarming not alarming but interesting thing of that statement is this is not just a growth asset this is a protection asset. They didn't say put this in your Roth IRA they said one to two percent across the board. So I think advisors have more knowledge than they're able to lead on because they're not allowed to really voice that opinion or that knowledge to the marketplace or specifically to their clients.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So my name is David J.Kansky. I'm the founder and CEO of Quantify Funds. I've been in the investment in ETF world for gosh about 17 years. The last 11 years I was a partner and portfolio manager at title financial group platform to help institutional managers bring ETFs to the marketplace. Took the jump and moved over to the client side and I'm now partnering with both title and another client of titles. The return stack ETF folks to bring you this stack lineup we have here,\nbut they're first offering being the STKD Bitcoin and Gold ETF ticker BTGD.</p>\n<p>So STKD is short for stacked. This is a stacked ETF. We stack two different assets on top of each other. In this case, we're stacking Bitcoin on top of gold. So for every dollar you put in the ETF, you get a $1 exposure to Bitcoin and a $1 exposure to gold. Alternatively, you can also think of it as a poor\nportfolio that is a 50, 50 mix of Bitcoin gold times two. So this is a new way to do leverage ETFs, where we're not just leveraging the same asset\non top of itself, which allows for what we'd like to call leverage for the long run,\nleverage with less path dependency and potential for decay.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin in its simplest form is digital gold. These are two assets that mine at a rate that is much smaller than the rate at which paper currency's print. Develop nations print about seven to nine percent of currencies and circulation each year. Bitcoin mines at about 0.86% a year,\nwhereas gold mines at about 1.75% a year. So in its simplest form at what pace will develop,\nmarkets around the world print their currency and the bet is that it's going to be over that 2% mark.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"I think the real bet is not necessarily what it is correlated to today, but what it will trend towards correlation wise in the future.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This 50-50 blend offers a leveraged, long-term approach without the typical path dependency or decay associated with traditional leverage products.</li>\n<li>Dziekanski explained that the fund targets a 5-7% rebalance drift to minimize trading costs while maintaining the desired asset allocation.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in income investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with David Dziekanski- Quantify Funds highlights important considerations around fixed income.

    "content": "<p>In a special edition of Behind the Ticker recorded at the UT CATT 2024 Global Analytics Conference, host Brad Roth moderated a panel discussion exploring the future of AI in finance. The panel brought together leading voices in the field: Kyle Wiggs, co-founder and CEO of UX Wealth Partners; Sudhir Holla, founder and CEO of MyStock DNA; and Tal Schwartz, founder of AI Funds. Together, they examined how artificial intelligence is revolutionizing portfolio management, addressing longstanding industry challenges, and opening up new possibilities for smarter investment strategies.</p>\n<h2>About Ai in Finance and UT CATT 2024 Global Analytics Conference</h2>\n<p>Kyle Wiggs highlighted the operational challenges and opportunities AI presents to financial advisors. He explained how UX Wealth Partners bridges the gap between sophisticated AI-driven strategies and practical implementation for end clients. By focusing on trading, billing, and reporting across multiple custodians and account structures, Wiggs emphasized the importance of scalability and efficiency in delivering cutting-edge solutions to the wealth management community. He also stressed that AI\u2019s role should complement human advisors rather than replace them, describing the concept as \u201cman and machine\u201d working together to enhance outcomes.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>Sudhir Holla brought a different perspective, emphasizing MyStock DNA\u2019s philosophy of \u201cwinning by not losing.\u201d He explained how their AI engine, Darwin, helps mitigate downside risk while managing large volumes of data and human emotions that often derail investment decisions. Holla introduced the concept of an \u201cemotional risk frontier,\u201d suggesting that AI could help create individualized portfolios tailored to each investor\u2019s emotional tolerance for market volatility. His analogy of AI as a \u201cself-driving car\u201d for portfolios resonated, showcasing how the technology navigates complex market conditions while aiming for safety and efficiency.</p>\n<p>Tal Schwartz provided insights into the quantitative and predictive power of AI in active portfolio management. He shared details about his AI engine, BAILA (Bayesian AI Learning Algorithm), which acts as both a macro strategist and portfolio optimizer. BAILA\u2019s ability to identify market environments and adapt to changing conditions offers a smarter alternative to traditional active strategies. Schwartz highlighted AI\u2019s capacity to outperform human managers by leveraging massive datasets and eliminating emotional biases, enabling portfolios to achieve asymmetric returns with minimized downside risk.</p>\n<h2>Portfolio Construction and Implementation</h2>\n<p>The panelists agreed on the transformative potential of AI but acknowledged challenges, including regulatory hurdles, biases in training data, and the need for human oversight. They emphasized that while AI has made significant strides, its most impactful applications lie ahead, particularly in democratizing access to sophisticated investment tools. The discussion underscored AI\u2019s potential to reshape finance, from enhancing risk management to delivering tailored solutions for investors at all levels.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Ai in Finance covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>You have under one hand passive strategies, where essentially you mimic an index, usually a capitalization weighted index, and then you have the active strategies, which today are mostly human run active strategies. Meaning there's a portfolio manager making a decisions about when to come in and out of the market and how much risk exposure to take and what assets to invest in. Now, if you look statistically at the active strategies, you can see that they statistically underperformed the benchmark.</p>\n<p>Next, we have an exciting panel on the future of smart investment strategies. And how AI is going to play a central role in this future. Let's invite our moderator, Brad Roth. Brad is a founding principal and chief investment officer at Thor Financial Technologies, which launched DHLV, a low-voltality ETF in September 2022. With over a decade of experience in creating operations and financial advisory, Brad has extensive expertise in investment strategies and fund management. Previously, he was a managing partner at Sardonex Capital managing a quantitative securities fund.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>I was a quantitative researcher at a few different hedge funds that could have been sitting down. And I had my own startup. And then in 2018, was deciding what I want to do next. And realize it was a big opportunity with AI and finance, which was my, my love. So, decide to start AI funds. What the idea, the vision at least, is that AI really is destined to manage most of the assets that are investible. And the reason I believe that is because, and this is before tragic picking everything else,\nis because I saw what AI is able to do with narrow AI in many, many different domains.</p>\n<p>Simply because AI for a bunch of reasons one it can process a lot more data than humans can it makes unemotional decisions and it's able to make predictions that are much more sophisticated using sophisticated machine learning models. They do a better job predicting both potential return and potential risk and as a result you're able to build smarter portfolios that will do better both in up markets and down markets. So that's a high level view of where things are going at least in my view and we can dive deep into how specifically we think we can help make that happen.</p>\n<p>And that ends up hurting our performance as human managers. And this would be mentioned AI does not have emotions, so it's actually able to take advantage of those situations and actually generate alpha during those situations.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d Al Chu, portfolio manager at Man GLG, discussed his role managing the American Beacon GLG Natural Resources ETF (ticker: MGNR). Chu, who has over two decades of experience in natural resources investing, described his journey from managing natural resources strategies at BNY Mellon and various hedge funds to leading this strategy at Man GLG. With the backing of Man Group, a UK-listed alpha-focused alternative manager, Chu\u2019s expertise is now accessible to a broader audience through the active ETF structure.</p>\n<h2>About Al Chu and American Beacon GLG Natural Resources ETF</h2>\n<p>Chu explained that MGNR takes a long-only, equity-based approach to natural resources investing, distinct from many other commodity ETFs that rely on futures or fund-of-funds models. The ETF focuses on equities within the natural resources space, such as oil producers, oilfield services, and mining companies, aiming to capitalize on alpha opportunities driven by commodity cycles. The active strategy allows the fund to adjust exposures dynamically, targeting subsectors and companies that offer the highest return potential based on commodity trends, regional dynamics, and bottom-up company analysis.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>A unique aspect of MGNR is its structured investment process, which begins with identifying favorable commodity cycles, then drilling down into specific subsectors, and finally selecting companies with strong fundamentals, management, and assets. Chu highlighted the importance of maintaining diversification within the fund, capping individual positions at 5% and limiting sector and subsector concentrations to manage risk effectively. The fund typically holds 40 to 50 names, representing a concentrated yet diversified exposure to the natural resources space.</p>\n<p>Chu also addressed the fund\u2019s appeal to advisors and investors looking for exposure to real assets with low correlation to traditional equities and bonds. MGNR is positioned as an alternative to passive commodity exposure, providing not only a hedge against inflation but also an opportunity to benefit from the operational and financial leverage of resource companies.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Al Chu covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>Very developed and very deep liquid markets. 80 to 90% of the listings are OECD,\nU.S., Canada, Australia, Western Europe. There is very little EM and no frontier market exposure. This is one of those I want to keep the risk\nas concentrated into the commodities and natural resources world\nfor us is taking something I'm intended\nto like a sovereign risk for my investors. So as you mentioned earlier,\nthe fund is active.</p>\n<p>So let's talk about the ETF, which is MGNR. It's the American beacon, natural resources ETF. You know, at a very high level, can you explain the investment strategy and what this fund is really trying to accomplish? Sure, so the, we, this is a, a long, only equity product. There's no derivatives, no leverage. And what we invest in is natural resources, equities. Now, this is different from a lot of the other products that are in the market and that one, it's an active ETF, right?</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>The, I think the core system to tend the main tenant of this fund really is alpha generation, right? And I think being an alternative, you know, asset manager, I think that that point is really prevalent across. I think the investors tend to think of commodities as they owe it's a broader beta play correlation of one. There's no, all goes up and it all goes down and that really is just not the case, right? If we look at the benchmark, the S&T global natural resources index or any benchmark, a commodities benchmark, he used to become index or the GSEI.</p>\n<p>It's rare to find a very small cab,\nill-liquid name in the top holdings,\njust because again, is that, you know,\ninvesting is all about managing the times you're wrong,\nas much as it is about managing what you're right. So if we're wrong, we have to be able to get out. That's liquidity, that's risk management. Two is the conviction level as well, right? Oftentimes, getting conviction to a name is a process, right?</p>\n<p>It was in the art products. I think these guys are having way ahead of the curve and way ahead of the ball in terms of getting in front of the active ETF movement. So they've been fantastic partners. So man group, man geology, man group. We do all the investing, running the actual portfolio and then American beach and helps us with the distribution.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"And, you know, at the end of the day, I still think that, you know, my opinion and my judgment would be the most important factor.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"Iron ore, what would be the biggest metals by volume and dollar traded was down over 50% at one point, right?\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The ETF focuses on equities within the natural resources space, such as oil producers, oilfield services, and mining companies, aiming to capitalize on alpha opportunities driven by commodity cycles.</li>\n<li>The active strategy allows the fund to adjust exposures dynamically, targeting subsectors and companies that offer the highest return potential based on commodity trends, regional dynamics, and bottom-up company analysis.</li>\n<li>A unique aspect of MGNR is its structured investment process, which begins with identifying favorable commodity cycles, then drilling down into specific subsectors, and finally selecting companies with strong fundamentals, management, and assets.</li>\n<li>The fund typically holds 40 to 50 names, representing a concentrated yet diversified exposure to the natural resources space.</li>\n<li>MGNR is positioned as an alternative to passive commodity exposure, providing not only a hedge against inflation but also an opportunity to benefit from the operational and financial leverage of resource companies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Al Chu highlights important considerations around income investing.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d Raymond Holst from Practus LLP discussed the intricacies of 351 exchanges and their relevance to the ETF industry. Holst, a tax attorney with over 20 years of experience, joined Practus in 2023, bringing extensive expertise in financial products and taxation. Practus, a fully virtual law firm with attorneys across the United States, specializes in ETF and mutual fund markets, offering tailored legal and tax solutions.</p>\n<h2>About Raymond Holst and Practus</h2>\n<p>Holst explained that a 351 exchange refers to a provision in the Internal Revenue Code allowing for the transfer of property into a corporation in exchange for shares without triggering immediate tax recognition on built-in gains. This mechanism is particularly useful for asset managers looking to convert separately managed accounts (SMAs) or private funds into an ETF wrapper. The process enables investors to transfer diversified securities portfolios into an ETF while maintaining their original tax basis and avoiding taxable events.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>Key requirements for a successful 351 exchange include maintaining at least 80% ownership in voting and value by transferors post-exchange and adhering to diversification rules. Holst elaborated on the 25/50 diversification test, which ensures that no single security exceeds 25% of the portfolio and the top five securities do not exceed 50%. These safeguards are essential to comply with tax regulations and ensure the exchange qualifies under the 351 provision.</p>\n<p>Holst emphasized the importance of partnering with experienced professionals for 351 exchanges, noting the complex coordination required among custodians, fund administrators, and legal advisors. While the process is tax-efficient, it involves significant logistical work, particularly in transferring tax information and establishing proper valuations. Once completed, however, ETFs formed through 351 exchanges operate like any other ETF, offering investors liquidity, marginability, and tax advantages.</p>\n<h2>Portfolio Construction and Implementation</h2>\n<p>For asset managers considering launching an ETF using a 351 exchange, Holst highlighted the long-term benefits, including improved tax efficiency and operational flexibility.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Raymond Holst covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>Everyone transfers in their existing securities portfolios. They take ETF shares back. So it's a hundred percent. So we never really run into problems. There are some outliers, but we never run into problems with that problem. The other prong is that what is being contributed needs to be a,\nif it's marketable securities, needs to be a diversified portfolio. And what that means is there's two tests. They're generally referred to as the twenty five fifty tests. And so you look at each, each transfer.</p>\n<p>Obviously, as the portfolio continue, hopefully the strategy produces positive returns,\nthat's going to increase the NAV and the price at which the ETF shares are traded,\nbut you're not going to recognize that tax until you actually sell the ETF shares. So, let me ask one final question I probably should have asked earlier. So, and this goes back to maybe walking through a real-world example, let's say,\nI'm going to try to make this very simple. I have an SMAM only running Apple.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>If you have an SMA account and you want to get at IBM and go into Apple, well, when you sell those IBM shares, obviously you have gain or loss, you take the proceeds of that, which, you know, is taking a 20% taxid probably. And so now you only have $80 to go into the other security with respect to ETFs. Can generally rebalance their portfolios using technology in the marketplace that it isn't a taxable event, so they can sell the $100 the IBM and move that $100 value into Apple without recognizing any tax.</p>\n<p>And so let's just start at the very top. What is a three fifty one exchange and how does it apply to an ETF? Well, being taxolors, we always need to speak in code. So what is three fifty one? Three fifty one is simply the provision in internal revenue code, which is used to create a corporation. And I'll give you a simple example. You have a property with a fair market value of fifty dollars. We both contributed that into the corporation exchange for corporate corporate shares.</p>\n<p>It's fifty fifty because we've contributed equal value. However, you bought that property. Let's say five years ago for twenty five dollars. So you have twenty five dollars of built-in gain in that property that you're contributing. And if you meet the requirements of three fifty one, what it says is when you contribute that property,\nyou don't have to recognize that gain at that time. What happens is you get a carryover basis in the shares that you receive. So with respect to an ETF and doing the initial seeding,\nthe idea is you're an asset manager and you have separately managed accounts or maybe you have a private fund.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"So that's why it's important to actually have people that you're working with that have done these transactions.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"One being tax efficiency, which is probably the biggest one, but it's really about just getting the ETF up and running.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Key requirements for a successful 351 exchange include maintaining at least 80% ownership in voting and value by transferors post-exchange and adhering to diversification rules.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in etf structure relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in etf structure relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Raymond Holst highlights important considerations around etf structure.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d Garrett Stevens and Rich Malinowski from Exchange Traded Concepts (ETC) discussed the firm\u2019s unique position as the first white-label ETF issuer and its role in supporting clients from concept to launch. ETC, which has been operating for 13 years, has launched over 100 ETFs with a combined $7.5 billion in assets under management. The firm provides a turnkey platform for ETF issuers, handling everything from regulatory filings and portfolio management to marketing and website development, while also offering individual services for established funds.</p>\n<h2>About Garrett Stevens & Rich Malinowski and Exchange Traded Concepts</h2>\n<p>Stevens highlighted a growing trend in the ETF industry: wealth management firms launching their own ETFs based on existing strategies. This shift allows advisors to offer tax-efficient, liquid, and operationally streamlined investment vehicles to their clients. He emphasized that these advisor-driven ETFs are often not marketed publicly but are used as tools to enhance the client experience and differentiate wealth management firms from competitors.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>The conversation also touched on the growing popularity of actively managed ETFs, which now account for about 75% of new launches. Stevens explained that while thematic and passive ETFs dominated early growth, the focus is now shifting toward active strategies that allow for sector rotation, cross-asset class exposure, and unique management styles. He noted that active ETFs require a longer runway for success, as they often depend on performance to attract investors, contrasting with the quicker adoption of thematic passive products.</p>\n<p>Rich Malinowski added insights on mutual fund-to-ETF conversions and semi-transparent ETF structures. He explained that while mutual fund conversions have slowed due to operational challenges and intermediary resistance, they remain an area of interest. Additionally, semi-transparent ETFs face hurdles related to their limited visibility for market makers and custodians, but Malinowski expects gradual acceptance as the industry adapts to these innovative products.</p>\n<h2>Portfolio Construction and Implementation</h2>\n<p>Both Stevens and Malinowski emphasized the importance of preparation and infrastructure for ETF issuers. They advised aspiring ETF managers to secure sufficient assets at launch, target a $30 million breakeven point, and build strong relationships with service providers to ensure operational success.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Garrett Stevens & Rich Malinowski covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>You have to establish performance. It's got to have\na trade record of it. It takes time to really bring a successful product to market. You've got, you know, the importance of a track record is as important for an ETF as it is for a\nmutual fund.</p>\n<p>So back when I was with Altimus, we did a, our first mutual fund conversion about three\nyears ago now. And it was quite a process, definitely a learning experience, it got done, successfully\nconverted, mutual fund with multiple share classes, consolidated, all of that, moved it over\nand now it's an exchange traded product. I think the trend has slowed down, mostly as a lot of the intermediaries and gatekeepers,\ndon't seem to be fans of it. At the same time, there's still questions about who's holding the products and how\nwill they hold them after a conversion that leave some questions on answered.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>And then you've got all of the recent share class applications with the SEC to copy the\nVanguard model and offer either an ETF share class of a mutual fund or a mutual fund share\nclass of an ETF. And I think the outcome of that is really going to end up dictating where conversions end\nup going. We could definitely see a lot of current active products not having to undergo a whole transformation\nif they can simply bolt on ETF abilities to a current mutual fund.</p>\n<p>And I think the industry is definitely meeting customer demand. With that said, I have no idea what's going to come down next on the pike, but at the\nsame time, whenever that idea comes up, I'm fairly certain that the industry is going\nto be pretty quick to respond to it. Gary, do you have any ideas around that? I mean, what we're seeing is certainly the trend is more towards active. At this point, I think 75% or something of new funds being launched are active at this\npoint, rather than the index based stuff.</p>\n<p>So, how do you view the growth, or how do we gain broader acceptance among investors\nwith these types of products? You know, I think that it, I think investors and advisors and the people bringing those\nare accepting them. I think there's a lot of operational nuance to the, to the non-transparent or semi-transparent. You have the whole market making community. You have gatekeepers at various wirehouses and things who are maybe less inclined to be\nin favor of the non-transparent.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"Well, we are actually here live at the ultimate client summit and I met one of your partners\nhere, Rich and so Rich, why don't I give you the opportunity to give your background and\nsay hello to everybody and kind of where you fit in over at ETC?\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"Well, I think the biggest\nthing that that we're seeing and that we talked to people about and to Rich's point, you know,\nthat this is a change is to try and make sure that when you bring the fund to market, you bring it\nwith some assets.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d Garrett Stevens and Rich Malinowski from Exchange Traded Concepts (ETC) discussed the firm\u2019s unique position as the first white-label ETF issuer and its role in supporting clients from concept to launch.</li>\n<li>The firm provides a turnkey platform for ETF issuers, handling everything from regulatory filings and portfolio management to marketing and website development, while also offering individual services for established funds.</li>\n<li>This shift allows advisors to offer tax-efficient, liquid, and operationally streamlined investment vehicles to their clients.</li>\n<li>The conversation also touched on the growing popularity of actively managed ETFs, which now account for about 75% of new launches.</li>\n<li>Stevens explained that while thematic and passive ETFs dominated early growth, the focus is now shifting toward active strategies that allow for sector rotation, cross-asset class exposure, and unique management styles.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Garrett Stevens & Rich Malinowski highlights important considerations around active management.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d Brett Eichenberger from Cohen & Company discussed the intricacies of auditing in the ETF and mutual fund industry. Eichenberger, based in the firm\u2019s Cleveland office, has worked his way up over a 19-year career with Cohen & Company, which now audits over 1,800 registered funds, making it the fourth-largest auditor of registered funds in the U.S. and the second-largest in the ETF space. Eichenberger emphasized Cohen\u2019s role in maintaining public trust through transparency and strict regulatory compliance, working with a range of investment products including ETFs, mutual funds, closed-end funds, and interval funds.</p>\n<h2>About Brett Eichenberger and Cohen & Co.</h2>\n<p>One of the central differences in auditing ETFs versus mutual funds, Eichenberger explained, lies in the valuation of securities. ETFs report returns on both NAV and market value bases, due to their trading on secondary markets, whereas mutual funds focus solely on NAV. Additionally, ETFs rely on authorized participants for capital activity through in-kind creation units, which introduces unique audit considerations, especially in managing the in-kind exchange of securities.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>Eichenberger highlighted several key areas of focus in ETF audits, such as ensuring accurate valuation, particularly in complex portfolios that may include derivatives, foreign securities, or illiquid assets. For products like ETFs, Cohen & Company pays close attention to maintaining diversification standards and testing qualified income, which is essential for regulatory compliance. Eichenberger explained how Cohen\u2019s audit teams perform regular assessments to verify all positions are accurately valued, confirming assets held in custody and ensuring that clients\u2019 funds meet regulatory diversification requirements.</p>\n<p>The discussion also touched on the impact of technology, including advancements in data-driven auditing that allow Cohen to move toward 100% testing of transactions, improving accuracy over traditional sampling methods. Eichenberger shared that the firm\u2019s adoption of automation enables more efficient audits, allowing for better oversight and faster processing.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Brett Eichenberger covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>So it's really important that we understand the valuation policies and procedures of the investment company,\nand making sure that they're following those for different types of securities. That's what we've spent a lot of our time when you think about some of the differences between ETFs and mutual funds. There are some nuances ETFs report out both total return on an AV basis, that asset value basis. But also because they're traded on the secondary markets, we also report out market value total return.</p>\n<p>Well a lot of ETF the one nice thing about ETFs is that most of them are in fairly liquid investments and and and open and funds are also you know restricted to so many percent of their assets being and non liquid investments 15%. So that's a good start for ETFs generally the when you're when you're putting together an ETF you're going to talk to your market makers you're going to want to make sure the names in your portfolio or liquid so when it comes to ETFs overall valuations generally better.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>If if you're going to have non qualified income in your portfolio do you need a blocker controlled foreign corporation blocker that's put in place to invest in certain securities whether that be. Bit going because it's not considered a security or a commodity so we see you know if you're in a commodity ETF and you want exposure to different futures contracts you'd have to do those within your controlled foreign corporation what that does. You don't need to do 25% of the fund in that but it allows that income to be qualified income when it gets paid from the CFC up into the parent fund so we'll see that structure put in place.</p>\n<p>So that's a new one similar to like a closed-end fund that you'd see in ETF versus a mutual fund. Some of the other differences that you'll see is the capital activity process. In a mutual fund, you have individuals buying and selling shares directly with the fund at an AV. Well, you still have an AV as the basis for buying and selling of the ETF, but they're done via creation units. And these are with authorized participants, not individual shareholders.</p>\n<p>A scenario where you'd have a material weakness internal controls if there was a problem within the. The audit of the financial statement so it's an it's an important piece and with the ETF structure as well when you think about it. Different shops are set up for trading as well some do the trading themselves some outsource the trading. So you may be the investment advisor but you may have a sub advisor that's doing the trading of the portfolio.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"That's what we've spent a lot of our time when you think about some of the differences between ETFs and mutual funds.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Additionally, ETFs rely on authorized participants for capital activity through in-kind creation units, which introduces unique audit considerations, especially in managing the in-kind exchange of securities.</li>\n<li>Eichenberger highlighted several key areas of focus in ETF audits, such as ensuring accurate valuation, particularly in complex portfolios that may include derivatives, foreign securities, or illiquid assets.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in fixed income relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Brett Eichenberger highlights important considerations around etf structure.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d Petra Bakosova from Hull adaptive discussed the unique approach behind the Hull adaptive Asset Allocation ETF, HTUS. Bakosova, who has been with Hull adaptive since its inception, has a background in applied mathematics and previously worked at proprietary trading firms. She explained that Hull adaptive\u2019s investment strategy draws inspiration from founder Blair Hull\u2019s background as both a blackjack card counter and a legendary options trader. Hull\u2019s principles\u2014making frequent, proportional bets based on advantage, and prioritizing risk management\u2014form the backbone of HTUS\u2019s adaptive approach.</p>\n<h2>About Petra Bakosova and Hull Tactical</h2>\n<p>HTUS, launched in 2015, is a adaptive asset allocation fund that aims to outperform the S&P 500 without exceeding its volatility. The fund combines data-driven market timing with quantitative models that analyze approximately 40 publicly available indicators. These indicators are organized into categories: macroeconomic factors, fundamentals, technical anomalies, and sentiment. The strategy is fully dynamic, adjusting S&P 500 exposure daily based on signals generated from these models. HTUS typically ranges from 50% to 150% exposure, though it has flexibility from fully invested to flat or even short.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>A unique feature of HTUS is its daily rebalancing, a process that allows the fund to remain agile and responsive to market changes. Bakosova detailed that HTUS leverages SPY and E-mini futures for S&P 500 exposure and incorporates SPX options to adjust for market sentiment and volatility. The fund\u2019s sentiment indicators include sources like MarketPsych, Halbert, and Ned Davis, which track social media and news sentiment. Bakosova highlighted the importance of diversification in HTUS\u2019s modeling process, as each indicator provides different market insights over various time horizons.</p>\n<p>HTUS is intended as a sophisticated, hedge fund-like strategy within an ETF structure, appealing to advisors seeking an alternative to traditional large-cap core holdings. Bakosova emphasized that Hull adaptive is focused on continual research and model refinement, with plans to incorporate more advanced AI and machine learning techniques.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Petra Bakosova covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>So, basically, we collect about 40 or so different\npublicly available indicators, and then we combine these indicators\ninto different models, and evaluate what we think the market is going to do. But on average, if our models don't give us a strong signal either way,\nwe will be 100% invested in the S&P 500. So, our co-explicory exposure will be by an old. And then, if we start getting signals, either bullish signals or berry signals,\nwe will deviate from this 100% exposures.</p>\n<p>We are live from the ultimate client summit down in Texas. And I have the pleasure of catching up with the handful of people there. But today we have on Petra, Bacca Silva. She is from Hall adaptive and we are talking about their Hall adaptive asset allocation ETF. This is an active strategy using 40 different indicators in order to create a hedge fund like product. Although the returns I would say are really appealing compared to a lot of hedge fund replication strategies.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>We rebalanced the portfolio once a day,\nand then we do bet proportional to our advantage. And once we go more into what's under the hood,\nI can talk more about like how we estimate our advantage on daily basis,\nand then third, you know, staying the game. So risk management is a big part of what we do,\nand what we pride ourselves on. So even though like our strategy includes futures and includes options,\nI do think one of our key advantages is our experience in risk management.</p>\n<p>So, generally speaking, we will only hold\na very few different assets,\nso we will have cash or cash instruments. So, things like money market funds or t-bills. And then we will have the the broad market index. I have to give us SNP500 exposure\nor any futures that also gives us SNP500 exposure. And then blended with our core market timing strategies. We also have two options strategies,\nwhich will invest in SPX options. And those will be anywhere from zero DTE\nto about a one month expiration.</p>\n<p>There is a segment of clients who are interested in,\nyou know, it's in terms of like the research under the hood,\nbut this is a hedge fund style strategy. Like we are closely tied to the SNP500,\nso we're not an absolute return hedge fund,\nbut in terms of the data we analyze and the techniques we use,\nthis is a pretty sophisticated strategy. So a lot of clients are interested in that,\nand especially if we can offer it an ETF wrapper\nfor ETF style fees, that is a very interesting proposal\nfor a lot of advisors.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"So, can you kind of walk us through the key components of the investment process\nand what really makes your approach unique?\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"And at the end of the day, you know,\nwe have an investment committee that gets together\nand looks at all these optimized weights versus what we have now\nand makes a decision about whether or not to make a change.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d Petra Bakosova from Hull adaptive discussed the unique approach behind the Hull adaptive Asset Allocation ETF, HTUS.</li>\n<li>HTUS, launched in 2015, is a adaptive asset allocation fund that aims to outperform the S&P 500 without exceeding its volatility.</li>\n<li>The fund combines data-driven market timing with quantitative models that analyze approximately 40 publicly available indicators.</li>\n<li>HTUS typically ranges from 50% to 150% exposure, though it has flexibility from fully invested to flat or even short.</li>\n<li>A unique feature of HTUS is its daily rebalancing, a process that allows the fund to remain agile and responsive to market changes.</li>\n<li>Bakosova highlighted the importance of diversification in HTUS\u2019s modeling process, as each indicator provides different market insights over various time horizons.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Petra Bakosova highlights important considerations around income investing.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d Joe Benoit, portfolio manager at Grimes & Company, discussed the firm\u2019s collaboration with Little Harbor Advisors on their ETF, the LHA Risk Managed Income ETF (ticker: RMIF). Benoit, who began his career with Grimes, now oversees portfolio management and research for the firm. Grimes & Company, a Massachusetts-based RIA managing over $5 billion in assets, follows a holistic approach to client portfolios, integrating stock, fixed income, and alternative strategies. Grimes\u2019s partnership with Little Harbor Advisors, known for adaptive equity ETFs, stemmed from a mutual interest in providing a adaptive fixed income solution, ultimately leading to RMIF.</p>\n<h2>About Joe Benoit and Grimes & Co.</h2>\n<p>RMIF, as Benoit explains, aims to generate consistent income while preserving capital and managing downside risk. This strategy originated in response to the post-2008 low-interest environment, as Grimes sought alternatives to traditional high-quality bonds. The ETF applies a fully adaptive, unconstrained approach to fixed income, allocating based on positive price trends and yield. RMIF can shift entirely into areas like high yield, bank loans, or even cash, depending on market conditions. This flexible allocation model allows the ETF to adjust risk exposure as trends change, making it a versatile solution for income-focused investors.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>Benoit details RMIF\u2019s approach to asset allocation, explaining that it prioritizes ETFs offering the highest yield within the current positive trends. Currently, the portfolio includes five ETFs, with equal weighting, primarily focusing on bank loans and short-duration high yield bonds. The strategy is momentum-based, utilizing price trends, volatility assessments, and yield comparisons to determine allocations. In periods of heightened volatility, RMIF can de-risk quickly, shifting allocations to safer assets like short-duration Treasuries or cash.</p>\n<p>Designed as an alternative to core fixed income, RMIF fits into portfolios as either a substitute for or complement to traditional bond investments. For advisors seeking \u201cconditional credit,\u201d RMIF\u2019s ability to tactically adjust to market shifts provides a reliable source of income with an added layer of risk management.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Joe Benoit covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>Yes, so, you know, it is a adaptive strategy, but internally we say that the goal is not\nto trade. It's, it's not a very high turnover strategy. You know, if trends are positive in some of our higher yielding areas of the market, like\ndomestic high yields, then we'll continue to own that until either the volatility in\nhigh yield picks up such that we have to start de-risking the portfolio or if the yield\nprofile and the market changes that something else might overtake it from a yield stem\nfund.</p>\n<p>So, so the yield profile largely depends on the,\nthe underlying fixed income environment and, and the other, the other thing that's complicated with\na adaptive strategy, if we were to have a yield threshold that we were trying to meet is,\nwhen the portfolio derisks, if the portfolio were to derisk in be a hundred percent in cash,\nfor example, like it has been at points in time, you know, money markets have yield today,\nwhich is great. But, you know, if you think back to much of the last 10 or 15 years,\nmoney market rates were zero.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>For example, we could de-risk completely to a safer area, it could be cash, it could\nbe high-quality fixed income, things like short duration treasuries, things like that. It really depends every market's going to behave slightly differently. There's been markets in the past where we've started to de-risk only for the volatility\nto fade and we start putting physicians back on. There's, there's been periods like 2022 is very bad for fixed income where trends were\njust negative everywhere, so we owned cash for an extended period of time.</p>\n<p>So, when we would have to derisk in the past, you know,\nit was one of those things where we were accepting the trade off of zero yield versus losing\nprinciple in some of the fixed income areas that were that were going down in value. So,\nwith yields, with yields low, you know, if you get a credit event or you get one of these\ndig duration moves that can happen quickly in these markets, the price move can easily overwhelm\nthe yield that you were receiving in that particular investment.</p>\n<p>So, if you've got a portfolio of traditional core fixed income,\nyou know, you could use this strategy as your conditional credit. So, when, when, you know,\nthings are good in the credit markets and volatility is low, it's going to be invested in some\nof those higher yielding segments for you. And, but you also know that if volatility were to\nstart picking up in the markets that the portfolio is going to shift. So, so those, I think, are some\nthose are the two big use cases that that I think we see for the strategy these days.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"It's, you know, at the end of the day, this is a fixed income strategy, what we're trying\nto do, all things can all things equal or trying to do is just generate yield, right?\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"For, for that reason, we allow the strategy to be more heavily concentrated\nin any one area versus if it was more fundamentally rooted.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>RMIF, as Benoit explains, aims to generate consistent income while preserving capital and managing downside risk.</li>\n<li>This flexible allocation model allows the ETF to adjust risk exposure as trends change, making it a versatile solution for income-focused investors.</li>\n<li>Designed as an alternative to core fixed income, RMIF fits into portfolios as either a substitute for or complement to traditional bond investments.</li>\n<li>For advisors seeking \u201cconditional credit,\u201d RMIF\u2019s ability to tactically adjust to market shifts provides a reliable source of income with an added layer of risk management.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Joe Benoit highlights important considerations around fixed income.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d David Allen, CFA and founder of Octane Investments, discussed his background in finance and the firm\u2019s strategy for its recently launched All-Cap Value Energy ETF (ticker: OCTA). Allen, who began his career in 1992 as a trader at Merrill Lynch and witnessed significant market events like the breaking of the Bank of England, developed a keen interest in geopolitics and energy markets early on. His experience spans institutional sales and trading, which later inspired him to start Octane Investments to capitalize on what he identified as a market gap created by divestment from traditional energy sectors.</p>\n<h2>About David Allen and Octane Investments</h2>\n<p>Allen explains that Octane Investments was founded to take advantage of the \u201ccarbon risk premium\u201d and other risk premiums inherent in the energy market, such as the equity risk premium, the small cap premium, and the value premium. The firm focuses on identifying undervalued companies in the energy sector, particularly those that are being overlooked or divested due to environmental concerns. OCTA, Octane\u2019s All-Cap Value Energy ETF, is structured around an all-cap value strategy, investing in energy companies with stable earnings, strong balance sheets, and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>Throughout the conversation, Allen emphasized the significant opportunity in traditional energy sectors, despite the increasing focus on sustainability and renewable energy. He highlighted that many investors are avoiding energy stocks, leading to a scarcity of capital and undervalued opportunities in the market. OCTA seeks to capture this value by focusing on companies that are profitable, financially stable, and returning capital to shareholders, such as through buybacks and debt elimination. Allen explained that the fund\u2019s holdings are curated based on a decision tree that screens for price-to-earnings ratios, balance sheet strength, and capital return strategies.</p>\n<p>Allen also touched on how OCTA offers exposure to a range of energy subsectors, including refiners and tankers, and discussed how the fund\u2019s structure mitigates risks by limiting exposure to any single company. The ETF is rebalanced weekly, and the portfolio includes companies from developed markets, avoiding exposure to non-OECD markets where political risks are higher. Allen sees OCTA as a strong complementary allocation for investors who are underweight in energy and stressed that, with energy representing less than 4% of the S&P 500, there is a structural underweight in the sector that his ETF addresses.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and David Allen covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>We want relatively stable E and a cheap P. So, that's the first basket. We got a data feed from empirical research partners. It's curated data feed on about 170 names that trade in the US. We buy AVRs, but only of developed world companies. So, however much I'd love to be in Petroprough or their gorgeous field. I don't want to lose 500 basis points overnight. If the people in Brazil change their minds about Petroprough. So, with that all-camp value approach,\nthe first decision tree node is price earnings.</p>\n<p>And in somewhere under the radar, I talk about a widget conglomerate. It's trading at a $100 million market cap. It's in every big index. When the German pension fund buys a global equity beta through\nMSCI world, they're putting, you know, 80 cents into this widget conglomerate. But the widget conglomerate, you can replicate their business\nby taking pieces of that and putting them together. So what I've manufactured in this 30 stock portfolio in octa\nand it is probably more volatile than you're integrated company.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>I think Jamie Diamond himself told Congress that it would be a hell of scale. If we lived in a world without the ability to burn hydrocarbons. And so I launched the firm to, as a pure reaction, a market reaction to this\nbirth of capital that's going to these publicly traded companies. So before we get to into the weeds on the energy sector and the ETF,\nwhat do you like to do when you're not working and when you're not behind the desk?</p>\n<p>For a couple of reasons, first of all,\nto sign a black rock and invent something much better overnight. And updated a lot better. In more importantly, I can't sell a black box if I didn't design it. So, I went back to the very basics. And I built a very simple decision tree. And the decision tree may be something like what you'd build. If you had a greenfield's approach to investing in the energy sector. The first node is PE.</p>\n<p>And so let's say we start with about 150 names. We try to take the top roughly one-third of those names\nfrom a forward PE ratio and from an introsectoral valuation. And so let's say we come up with call in 50 or 60 names. And then we do the debt to equity test. Now this is where a little bit of art comes into the science. Because if we're looking at six or seven sub-sectors,\nif you have let's say a scale refiner,\na household name refiner that ends up in, for example, cows\nand other successful ETFs, you create cash flow,\ngreat buybacks.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"Because it seems like it's the biggest hobby in this business for some reason.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"But some of the biggest clients that I had mainly East Coast public funds were going whole\nsale out of traditional energy companies.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The firm focuses on identifying undervalued companies in the energy sector, particularly those that are being overlooked or divested due to environmental concerns.</li>\n<li>OCTA seeks to capture this value by focusing on companies that are profitable, financially stable, and returning capital to shareholders, such as through buybacks and debt elimination.</li>\n<li>Allen also touched on how OCTA offers exposure to a range of energy subsectors, including refiners and tankers, and discussed how the fund\u2019s structure mitigates risks by limiting exposure to any single company.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with David Allen highlights important considerations around risk management.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d Federico Brokate, Head of U.S. Business at 21Shares, shared insights into the firm\u2019s approach to digital asset ETFs, including their products ARKB (Spot Bitcoin ETF) and CETH (Spot Ethereum ETF). Having joined 21Shares three months ago, Brokate brings a wealth of experience from his ten-year tenure at BlackRock, where he focused on U.S. ETFs. 21Shares, headquartered in Zurich, is dedicated to making digital assets more accessible through innovative products and has been rapidly expanding with over 50 products in 16 global markets.</p>\n<h2>About Federico Brokate and 21Shares</h2>\n<p>Brokate explained that 21Shares was founded in 2016 with a clear mission to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. The company\u2019s founders, inspired by their mothers\u2019 interest in Bitcoin, realized there was no easy way for retail investors to access digital assets without understanding the complexities of wallets, keys, and encryption. This led to the creation of 21Shares\u2019 digital asset ETPs, which now offer institutional-grade products in both Europe and the U.S.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>Regarding the current digital asset landscape, Brokate highlighted the tremendous success of Bitcoin ETFs, noting that digital asset ETFs, including 21Shares\u2019 ARKB, have become some of the fastest-growing ETFs in history. He emphasized the importance of educating advisors and clients, particularly in the wealth advisory and institutional spaces, where interest in digital assets is rising but knowledge gaps remain. He mentioned that a significant portion of digital asset ETF holders are retail investors, but interest from institutional investors and wealth advisors is growing steadily.</p>\n<p>Brokate also discussed the operational aspects of 21Shares\u2019 products, explaining that both ARKB and CETH utilize a multi-custodial model with custodians like Coinbase, Anchorage, and BitGo to reduce single points of failure and ensure robust operational security. He noted that 21Shares is the only issuer currently offering this level of transparency, allowing investors to verify the holdings of each product through a partnership with Chainlink, which provides proof of reserve technology. This transparency, combined with the firm\u2019s experience in managing digital asset products, has positioned 21Shares as a leader in the space.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Federico Brokate covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>So maybe you can get a little bit more in the weeds there just out of my\ncuriosity because I haven't done the research. So the team, I'm used to the traditional\ncreator team process in a traditional ETF. So is it different in the Bitcoin space and then\non top of that you mentioned multiple custodians? Is there what is the decision making on\nwhere it gets custodyed or is it all split evenly? Can you just go a little bit deeper there?</p>\n<p>I think this was a part of the market\nthat was very quick attention to these products and was a huge driver of demand and flows,\nespecially in the first few obviously the first quarter, really of trading. And so we were\nfortunate to count with the strong client based from both the social side and from the retail side\nfrom the early days. Now, there's a lot of great successful Bitcoin products in the market today,\nbut I think what we were able to do differently was really lead into that research capability\nthat we've developed over the last few years and some of those educational content series that we\nhave to help educate retail investors too.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>First is explaining to the advisor why they should\ncare inherently about Bitcoin in the first place, right? And I think what's you make the place for\nthe need for an asset like Bitcoin? The second part of the conversation becomes much easier,\nwhich is, okay, if I add Bitcoin to my portfolio, the first thing they'll think about is the\nincrease in volatility. But what does it do to my risk of just the returns on a full year basis, right?</p>\n<p>And so, when I break it down into those three,\nwe're seeing tremendous progress across all of them. You know, retail investors have been\nrapidly adopting these products in the early endings and we continue to see that. I think we're particularly excited about that because they're really the fire that has gone\ndigital assets become mainstream as you will. So, we're around 75 to 80% of all digital\nor Bitcoin ETF assets are held by retail today. And so, when you think about that and\ncomparison to the rest of capital markets, it's a quite the embrace, right?</p>\n<p>And so\nwhen I think about who would be an early adopter for this product, it would really be that\ncrypto native or that crypto adjacent crowd that was looking to provide this exposure to the portfolio. But perhaps because of the lack of staking, they stayed on the sidelines so far. And the third\nthing that I mentioned a little bit earlier was some of this macro point where, you know, if I\nlook at QQQ for example, as a proxy for growth equity is especially in the US prices are largely\nmoved sideways for the last few months, right?</p>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The company\u2019s founders, inspired by their mothers\u2019 interest in Bitcoin, realized there was no easy way for retail investors to access digital assets without understanding the complexities of wallets, keys, and encryption.</li>\n<li>He noted that 21Shares is the only issuer currently offering this level of transparency, allowing investors to verify the holdings of each product through a partnership with Chainlink, which provides proof of reserve technology.</li>\n<li>This transparency, combined with the firm\u2019s experience in managing digital asset products, has positioned 21Shares as a leader in the space.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Federico Brokate highlights important considerations around crypto & digital assets.

Davis was intrigued by the ETF structure for its tax efficiencies and saw an opportunity to address gaps in traditional fixed income products like the Aggregate Bond Index (AGG) and TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities). IVOL, Quadratic\u2019s interest rate volatility and inflation hedge ETF, was designed to complement core bond holdings, addressing issues in the AGG such as its lack of inflation protection and embedded short optionality through mortgages. IVOL provides investors with exposure to TIPS and the rates market, offering inflation protection and interest rate volatility hedging, which is generally inaccessible to individual investors.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>Davis explained that IVOL\u2019s portfolio consists of about 80% TIPS and is structured to give investors access to inflation expectations beyond the consumer price index (CPI). By providing exposure to interest rate volatility through long options, IVOL helps mitigate risk in fixed income portfolios during periods of rising volatility or unexpected rate cuts, as demonstrated during events like the March 2020 market turmoil.</p>\n<p>The conversation also touched on BNDD, Quadratic\u2019s deflation-focused ETF, which is designed for long-duration exposure to nominal treasuries. Davis highlighted that BNDD offers asymmetric exposure to interest rates without the leverage risks that are prevalent in other bond market products. While IVOL addresses inflation risks, BNDD offers protection during deflationary periods, making both ETFs complementary tools for managing interest rate risks in a portfolio.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Nancy Davis covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>So when you own an option, you're long-ball. We happen to own interest rate ball so it's just\nsomething else and I think that goes back to your point Bradley about the correlation. It doesn't\nlook like everything else, right? It's not another strategy that's plus or minus 25 basis points\nto a benchmark index. So it's not always going to make money,\nyou know, investing definitely involves risk but something that gives you access to something that\nyou probably don't already have inside your portfolio.</p>\n<p>So the market is already pricing that inflation will\nbelow that 2% target in the future, and so to me, I think it's just a great opportunity to say,\nlook, interest rate ball doubt is down tremendously since Silicon Valley Bank. Nothing has really\nfundamentally changed at all, right, all those same issues exist of anything we're kind of facing\na bigger fiscal situation, no matter who wins in November, nobody is talking about reducing\nour debt, right? It's just a question of where we're going to spend money, so I think it's a\ngreat time to help diversify the ag and have some exposure to inflation and inflation expectations\nin the future outside of CPI, because CPI is only calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics\nand a third of that index is rent, and then I just personally, I just don't like only being short\nvolatility in my bond portfolio, like it makes me uneasy at night, and I don't think a lot of people\nrealize that mortgages, although there is single case product, close your eyes, homeowners along\nthe option, if you own the financial mortgage, you are short options to homeowners, and whenever\nyour short options, your short ball, it's not equity ball, it's not the vix, it's actually fixed\nincome ball.</p>\n<p>TIPs are a pretty new market, it's just\nimportant for people to understand the treasury only started issuing inflation protected bonds\nin the late 90s. The only index is CPI and a lot of people just say, okay here's our core holding\nin the AG and we're going to add I-Gaw on top of that to add exposure to TIPs and also exposure\nto inflation expectations outside CPI. So correlation, I was looking at your correlation matrix,\nit's extremely attractive, so if you're sitting down with, you know, a portfolio manager that\nhas an already diversified portfolio, where are you recommending I-Gaw gets a seat?</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"Most people have stocks and bonds in\ntheir financial portfolio, but the biggest asset cost in the world is interest rate, so we really\nsee it as an access vehicle.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"Nothing has really\nfundamentally changed at all, right, all those same issues exist of anything we're kind of facing\na bigger fiscal situation, no matter who wins in November, nobody is talking about reducing\nour debt, right?\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>IVOL, Quadratic\u2019s interest rate volatility and inflation hedge ETF, was designed to complement core bond holdings, addressing issues in the AGG such as its lack of inflation protection and embedded short optionality through mortgages.</li>\n<li>IVOL provides investors with exposure to TIPS and the rates market, offering inflation protection and interest rate volatility hedging, which is generally inaccessible to individual investors.</li>\n<li>The conversation also touched on BNDD, Quadratic\u2019s deflation-focused ETF, which is designed for long-duration exposure to nominal treasuries.</li>\n<li>Davis highlighted that BNDD offers asymmetric exposure to interest rates without the leverage risks that are prevalent in other bond market products.</li>\n<li>While IVOL addresses inflation risks, BNDD offers protection during deflationary periods, making both ETFs complementary tools for managing interest rate risks in a portfolio.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Nancy Davis highlights important considerations around fixed income.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d Mike Venuto, co-founder and CIO of Tidal Financial Group, shared insights into the company\u2019s approach to launching, growing, and operating ETFs. Tidal, a firm that has grown significantly over the years, now manages and supports over 160 funds with more than $19 billion in assets under management. Venuto, who has a background in ETFs dating back to his time at WisdomTree and Global X, highlighted Tidal\u2019s unique platform that helps clients from initial idea generation to full-scale ETF operations.</p>\n<h2>About Mike Venuto and Tidal: The ETF Masters</h2>\n<p>Venuto discussed his hands-on role at Tidal, which involves structuring ETFs, managing active funds, and collaborating closely with clients to develop innovative products. A key focus of the conversation was on the breadth of Tidal\u2019s capabilities, from handling compliance and legal matters to marketing and product development. The company prides itself on offering a comprehensive service, allowing ETF issuers to focus on managing their portfolios while Tidal handles the operational complexities.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>One of Tidal\u2019s standout achievements is its ability to launch ETFs quickly and affordably, compared to the traditional process. Venuto explained that while starting an ETF independently can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and take up to nine months, Tidal can often bring funds to market in under four months at a fraction of the cost. This efficient process, combined with the firm\u2019s expertise in complex strategies such as options, derivatives, and leverage, has allowed Tidal to grow rapidly, especially in the active ETF space, which has seen significant demand.</p>\n<p>Venuto also touched on trends in the ETF market, including the growing interest in active strategies, single stock ETFs, and the potential for mutual fund-to-ETF conversions. He noted that while mutual fund conversions have been slow, the demand for more tax-efficient ETF structures continues to rise. Additionally, Venuto emphasized that Tidal only partners with clients who have strong, viable product ideas, ensuring that the firm maintains a low fund closure rate and helps clients succeed in a competitive market.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Mike Venuto covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>And I can say this, the SEC can come back me on the head if they want to. But I can guarantee that if you're a taxable investor and you're choosing between the same strategy and a mutual fund versus an ETF, 99% or 94% of the time you're going to be way more tax efficient in the ETF.</p>\n<p>Our Sharia portfolio is when we met them, they had $80 million. They now have four ETFs with us and then they have mutual funds as well and like $750 million. And so, cook bonds and reach, like four, it's just under four years.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>Nancy and crews are very different. We're not meeting with management. We're not making a call on the business. What we're doing is we have a research agreement with unusual whales. And the partner in that is a company called subversive who set up everything originally and then they brought us into actively manage it. When they were managing it in the previous iteration, it was extremely, extremely diversified. One fund had Nancy had 700 stocks, plus and crews was like 400 plus.</p>\n<p>There's micro baskets at the Greg Rex has done some stuff there. So I think there's going to be a lot of giving people trading vehicles that are associated with things that they're excited about. I do think that my friend Wes at alpha architect hit on something interesting what box right like it does seem like there's this appetite for even more tax advantage strategies than just traditional ETFs. Haven't seen anybody else do anything quite like it yet. I'm sure there'll be iterations but I do think there's some opportunities there that could be a huge mega trend because it certainly seems like taxes are going up.</p>\n<p>If you come to us, most ETFs we can launch for under 70,000 and do it in less than four months. Unless it's complicated at which point we're going to walk you through all those complications and get you there. Number two, everything that's coming to market and succeeding right now,\nall the launches this year that are working are active. And not only are they active, they're complex. And complex means, like we said, Jerry Parker or Yield Max or Corey Hofstein with return stack,\nthey're using things like options derivatives leverage.</p>\n<p>If you're assets are at Morgan Stanley or UBS you they're going to get upset and you're going to argue and then you're going to restart know that my suggestion them is always let's start the founders ETF or the your flagship ETF right and you make it a concentrated portfolio of your top picks and then you buy the ETF and your mutual fund so you. You know your large cap fund might buy 10% in the ETF and your mid cap might only buy five but some of those ideas are in every one of your strategies.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"Yeah, I mean, it's a tagline, obviously, but the whole point of it was the experience, right?\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"And I think that's why we've seen the explosion that we've seen.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Venuto, who has a background in ETFs dating back to his time at WisdomTree and Global X, highlighted Tidal\u2019s unique platform that helps clients from initial idea generation to full-scale ETF operations.</li>\n<li>A key focus of the conversation was on the breadth of Tidal\u2019s capabilities, from handling compliance and legal matters to marketing and product development.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in fixed income relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Mike Venuto highlights important considerations around etf structure.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d Sylvia Jablonski, CEO & CIO of Defiance ETFs, shared her background in finance and the innovative strategies driving the firm\u2019s success. Jablonski, who has a rich history in sales & trading and a decade of experience with ETFs, decided to join Matt Bielski to help launch Defiance, a company that aims to create ETFs targeting cutting-edge themes. Over the last four and a half years, Defiance has grown significantly, expanding its product lineup to include thematic, income, and leveraged ETFs.</p>\n<h2>About Sylvia Jablonski and Defiance ETFs</h2>\n<p>Jablonski discusses the firm\u2019s thematic approach, with a special focus on their quantum computing ETF, QTUM. Launched in 2018, QTUM was ahead of the curve in recognizing the potential of quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Jablonski explains that Defiance worked with Bluestar to construct an index that includes the top companies in quantum computing and AI, from major players like IBM and Hewlett-Packard to smaller, pure-play names like IonQ and D-Wave. The fund offers investors diversified exposure to the key sectors driving these transformative technologies.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>The QTUM ETF targets companies that derive at least 50% of their revenue from supercomputing, machine learning, and AI. The fund holds around 70 equally weighted names and is rebalanced semi-annually, providing exposure to both large and small-cap companies. This includes established tech giants like Nvidia and Google, which act as a ballast for the fund, while also capturing the potential high growth of emerging players in quantum computing. Jablonski highlights that quantum computing\u2019s ability to process data exponentially faster than traditional computers can revolutionize industries such as biotech, aerospace, and defense, making QTUM a powerful thematic play for long-term growth.</p>\n<p>In addition to discussing QTUM, Jablonski touches on the overall strategy at Defiance, emphasizing the importance of speed, adaptability, and listening to market demands. She explains that Defiance\u2019s ability to be nimble and respond quickly to trends has been key to their success. The firm has also built an in-house marketing and distribution platform, leveraging AI and digital marketing to efficiently promote its ETFs. This unique approach has allowed Defiance to punch above its weight, attracting attention in a competitive market without the extensive budgets of larger issuers.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Sylvia Jablonski covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>I'm geared towards tech and AI which is amazing, but we need something else right so. And enter the enhanced income product suite and so, you know, we realize that there's this huge interest in in index base exposure with which with large monthly distribution payments. Or weekly distribution payments that investors are seeking and so we launched. You know, the enhanced product suite like the KQI, IW, my jeffy and then the target income funds and those grew right away.</p>\n<p>So it's basically like the leading global companies in research, commercialization of anything related to cloud computing. So that could be like high powered computing data connectivity solutions. It could be cooling systems. It could be, you know, companies that specialize in like perception and collection and management of data used in machine learning. It can be semi-conductor companies that invest in super computing and high speed computing. And, and basically, you know, these are, and these all sound like foreign things, I guess, but you'll recognize a lot of the names in there, right?</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So let's, let's stick on the those single stock levered theme for a moment, right? You mentioned micro strategy that's kind of also a little bit of a crypto play and it of itself. So you actually recently filed to increase the leverage, I believe it was 1.75, it's now you're filing for two. So what's the internal dialogue around like turning up that volume just a little bit and for the increase leverage is it just to make the product a little bit spicier is that what people are asking for like what's the thought processor on that?</p>\n<p>And so we started to your point, we started having success with getting our brand out there and then other ETF companies would call us and say, like, how on earth are you guys, how are you doing this? Like, you can't possibly have any money or so small, you have like two or three ETFs. And then they offered to hire us to do their marketing. And so, you know, we, we do marketing for some of the top ETF providers in the marketplace right now and that ended up turning into a business and so we separated it out from, because it was just kind of under defiance ETFs originally, we separated it out now.</p>\n<p>Now one thing to note, we did lose about the last 20 seconds of audio. So thank you Riverside FM. However, all you really missed was some thank yous and their website which is DefianceETFs.com.</p>\n<p>Hey Sylvia, welcome to the show. Thanks so much for having me, happy to be here. So before we get started, why don't you share everybody a bit about your background and how you eventually decided to kind of start to finance.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"I got the opportunity to join direction ETFs, which is the levered number of CTF issuers and I work there for like a decade or so.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Jablonski, who has a rich history in sales & trading and a decade of experience with ETFs, decided to join Matt Bielski to help launch Defiance, a company that aims to create ETFs targeting cutting-edge themes.</li>\n<li>The fund offers investors diversified exposure to the key sectors driving these transformative technologies.</li>\n<li>The QTUM ETF targets companies that derive at least 50% of their revenue from supercomputing, machine learning, and AI.</li>\n<li>The fund holds around 70 equally weighted names and is rebalanced semi-annually, providing exposure to both large and small-cap companies.</li>\n<li>She explains that Defiance\u2019s ability to be nimble and respond quickly to trends has been key to their success.</li>\n<li>This unique approach has allowed Defiance to punch above its weight, attracting attention in a competitive market without the extensive budgets of larger issuers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Sylvia Jablonski highlights important considerations around income investing.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d James St. Aubin, Chief Investment Officer of Ocean Park Asset Management, shared insights into his firm\u2019s approach to managing risk and growing client assets. With over two years at Ocean Park and a background that includes stints at Smith Barney, Wilshire, and Ibbotson Associates, St. Aubin has extensive experience in asset allocation and portfolio construction. He explains that Ocean Park\u2019s core philosophy, dating back to its founding in the mid-1980s, is focused on downside protection and mitigating exposure to left-tail risk, particularly for retirees or those nearing retirement.</p>\n<h2>About James St. Aubin and Ocean Park Asset Management</h2>\n<p>Ocean Park offers a range of solutions, including four ETFs, eight mutual funds under the Sierra brand, and packaged fund strategist portfolios for advisors. The firm\u2019s investment strategy revolves around quantitative trend-following techniques, using banded moving averages to identify buy and sell signals in its target markets. This methodology, which emphasizes capital preservation by limiting exposure to market downturns, is particularly important for investors seeking to avoid large losses during volatile periods.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>The discussion also centered on Ocean Park\u2019s recently launched ETF, DUKQ, which focuses on U.S. domestic equities. St. Aubin explains that DUKQ applies the same quantitative, trend-based approach as the firm\u2019s other strategies, investing in ETFs that cover a broad range of market exposures, including small cap, mid cap, and factor-based strategies. DUKQ holds around 10 to 12 ETFs when fully invested and has the ability to move entirely to cash during market sell-offs if all assets signal a downturn.</p>\n<p>One of the key advantages of DUKQ, according to St. Aubin, is its ability to protect against extreme market events while still participating in market gains. The ETF can redeploy capital to other sectors if certain segments trigger a sell signal, rather than immediately moving all assets into cash. This flexibility ensures that the fund remains actively managed, with turnover averaging around two trades per year.</p>\n<h2>Portfolio Construction and Implementation</h2>\n<p>As ETFs become a more critical part of Ocean Park\u2019s overall offering, St. Aubin emphasizes the importance of meeting advisor demand for these products. The firm\u2019s decision to launch ETFs, including DUKQ, was driven by the growing preference for ETFs among advisors due to their tax efficiency and ease of use. St. Aubin believes that ETFs, along with the firm\u2019s mutual funds and managed portfolios, provide advisors with flexible, adaptive tools to manage client risk and return.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and James St. Aubin covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>So we looked at all the opportunities that we could invest in during our research process\nand said, okay, which ones are the most complementary to each other? And that's how we narrowed it down to a smaller list of the individual ETFs that have specific\nmarket exposures that we think will be additive to the diversification of the portfolio overall.</p>\n<p>And that happened from time to time when the markets in complete meltdown mode, the\noptionality to go to cash, I think, is what really gives us an advantage. We don't like to be in cash, that's not a target allocation for us, but if we need to\nbe, we can be. And so, the portfolio can be 100% cash if all of the funds in the opportunity set are\nin sales, sales signals, then the fund will be 100% in cash.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So our research refined the list of names. So we do have a bench and a list of what, what if all the funds within our, our bench\nare opportunity set that's been pre-defined, have buy signals, they will all be in a portfolio,\nhave exposure in the portfolio at a certain weight. We did, we decided what funds, now that includes broad market exposures like the S&P 500\nand QQQ, or the NASDAQ 100, but also small cap and mid cap exposure as well.</p>\n<p>Yeah, so for domestic equities, obviously, everybody with equity exposure has some exposure\nto domestic equities, and it really depends on an advisor or a particular client's risk\nversion, right? Some folks have greater need, greater comfort with something as strategy with more downside\nprotection, so this can fill the entire domestic equity bucket for a particular allocation. Now, that's not necessarily everybody's speed, so we also say it's not zero, it doesn't\nhave to be 100%, but somewhere in there really, it's in a lot of times it's up to the\nadvisor to determine, all right, how much protection do I want to put in the portfolio?</p>\n<p>And that is an automatic, unemotional cell and we will eliminate that in the portfolio. Now, under certain conditions that may be redeployed to other funds that are still in\nbi-signals for us, if certain funds are not in bi-signals, we can hold cash. And so that, I think that's our defensive nature is to be able to hold cash during those\nperiods of broad market declines. That has been, we think the, the value in our, in our strategy is to be able to, whether\nthe storm, so to speak, by holding cash when markets are declining broadly.</p>\n<p>He's from Ocean Park asset management where they do a number of things whether it's their\nsolutions business, their mutual fund business and their growing ETF business. Today we're here to talk about DuckQDUKQ, which is their domestic equities ETF, focusing\nat the conversation really on the signaling process, how the ETF operates and where it fits\ninside an overall model portfolio.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"And so, the portfolio can be 100% cash if all of the funds in the opportunity set are\nin sales, sales signals, then the fund will be 100% in cash.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"And that's where we came to the realization that we need to be able to deliver to those\nadvisors and clients that want ETF exposure.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ocean Park offers a range of solutions, including four ETFs, eight mutual funds under the Sierra brand, and packaged fund strategist portfolios for advisors.</li>\n<li>This methodology, which emphasizes capital preservation by limiting exposure to market downturns, is particularly important for investors seeking to avoid large losses during volatile periods.</li>\n<li>The discussion also centered on Ocean Park\u2019s recently launched ETF, DUKQ, which focuses on U.S.</li>\n<li>DUKQ holds around 10 to 12 ETFs when fully invested and has the ability to move entirely to cash during market sell-offs if all assets signal a downturn.</li>\n<li>One of the key advantages of DUKQ, according to St.</li>\n<li>This flexibility ensures that the fund remains actively managed, with turnover averaging around two trades per year.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with James St. Aubin highlights important considerations around portfolio construction.

After a brief stint in corporate PR, he found his passion for ETFs and has spent over 14 years as a portfolio manager and chief operating officer at Teucrium. As he engaged with aspiring ETF creators over the years, Harris found himself answering the same questions about launching and managing ETFs, which ultimately led him to write his book as a comprehensive guide for future ETF entrepreneurs.</p>\n<h2>About Springer Harris and Get ETF'd</h2>\n<p>Harris explains that Get ETF\u2019d is aimed at educating asset managers and entrepreneurs about the intricacies of launching an ETF. His book walks readers through the entire process, from understanding industry terminology to selecting the right service providers, regulatory structures, and marketing strategies. He emphasizes the importance of planning, particularly the need for a three-year business plan to ensure the sustainability of a new ETF. Harris stresses that simply launching an ETF is not enough\u2014entrepreneurs must be prepared to invest in marketing, build their brand, and stay committed for the long haul.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>One of the key insights Harris provides is the distinction between different paths to launching an ETF. He discusses the advantages and drawbacks of building your own ETF business, partnering with a white-label provider, or creating a hybrid approach. While white-label solutions offer a faster and more cost-effective way to launch an ETF, they also come with trade-offs in terms of control and profitability. Harris advises entrepreneurs to evaluate their long-term goals and business plans before deciding which path to take.</p>\n<p>Throughout the conversation, Harris emphasizes the importance of perseverance and adaptability in the ETF industry. He acknowledges that not every strategy will succeed, and closing an ETF can be a difficult but necessary decision. However, he encourages entrepreneurs to view such setbacks as learning experiences and to remain focused on their long-term vision.

And we've done a really good job at as an industry,\neducating end users on the features of ETFs,\nhow they were, why you would use them. But let's be honest, right? That was pretty self-serving education. And we did that so that more people would adopt the ETF as an investor,\nand we would all have more investors and our funds, right? And we needed to do it and there's still a lot of education left to do,\nwhich is why you still see ETF issuers hosting regularly about,\nhow does an ETF work?</p>\n<p>But now all of a sudden, the ecosystem for your customer is anybody with a brokerage account,\nright? As long as you can get your fund on the platform,\nas long as a person can sign into their brokerage account,\ntype in your ticker,\nand click by,\nthey're a potential customer. And so it changes the landscape of who you can market to,\nI mean, let's be honest,\nin the ETF space,\nwhen we're marketing,\nyou're marketing to everyone all the time.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>They want to focus on what they do best. They want to manage their strategy. They want to go out and market their fund, right? And if that's all you want to do,\nthen the white labels great for you. You have to recognize that you're going to get those efficiencies,\nbut on the other side, you're paying a whole team of people\nto do all the work for. And so when you do less, you make less, right? You don't know your own lawn.</p>\n<p>So I'm lucky enough to have spent basically my entire career in the ETF industry and rare enough that I've actually spent that whole time at the same firm. Out of college, I was actually invited to join two cream at that point. I didn't even know what an ETF was and two cream hadn't even launched its first fund. And so I wanted to have a little bit more stability in life and so I started to go down the corporate route.</p>\n<p>What are the different paths? How long does it take? How much does it cost, right? And I found myself just sending hours answering the same questions for folks,\nwhich struck me as an opportunity. And so I was invited onto a podcast back then to talk about how to start in old\nETF. And it spent a lot of time framing out how I was going to talk about that,\nhow I was going to present it. And I thought like great, this is this awesome piece of evergreen content that I'm going to be able to make\nand help people start ETFs, right?</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"And I lay out basically how you can build\na small team or the biggest team internally, right?\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"And so the biggest piece of advice that I can give there is really\nchoose your business partners,\nyour service providers,\nas if you were choosing business partners and employees.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>He emphasizes the importance of planning, particularly the need for a three-year business plan to ensure the sustainability of a new ETF.</li>\n<li>One of the key insights Harris provides is the distinction between different paths to launching an ETF.</li>\n<li>Throughout the conversation, Harris emphasizes the importance of perseverance and adaptability in the ETF industry.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Springer Harris highlights important considerations around etf structure.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d Howard Chan, founder of Kurv Investment Management, discussed his unique approach to ETFs and how his firm leverages institutional-grade strategies to benefit all investors. Chan, who began his career as an engineer, transitioned to finance after stints at Goldman Sachs and PIMCO, where he led the ETF business in Europe. After returning to the U.S., Chan was inspired by discussions with advisors to launch Kurv Investment Management with a mission to make tax-efficient, institutional-grade strategies accessible to a broader range of investors.</p>\n<h2>About Howard Chan and Kurv Investment Management</h2>\n<p>Kurv\u2019s focus on tax efficiency and institutional-grade strategies is central to its product design. Chan explains that while many institutional strategies are highly effective, they are often tax-inefficient for retail investors. Kurv\u2019s goal is to bring these sophisticated strategies to all investors while minimizing tax implications. One way the firm achieves this is by incorporating techniques such as volatility risk premia and other derivatives, previously only available to the largest institutions, into their ETFs.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>A key highlight of the conversation is Kurv\u2019s innovative technology-focused ETF, the KQQQ ETF (also referred to as \u201cKQs\u201d). This fund targets strategic exposure to the largest technology companies, aiming to deliver asymmetric upside while mitigating downside risk through dynamic covered call strategies. Chan explains that KQQQ is designed for investors who seek growth in technology but are also concerned about the sector\u2019s inherent volatility. The ETF combines momentum signals with a dynamic covered call strategy to capture upside during growth phases and generate income during periods of market correction or sideways trading.</p>\n<p>Chan further discusses how KQQQ leverages smart security selection by focusing on 15 to 20 of the most dominant technology names, including companies that have fundamentally changed their industries through technological innovation. The fund dynamically overweights stocks showing positive momentum and deploys covered call strategies on those exhibiting negative momentum, creating a balanced approach that seeks to maximize returns while protecting against downside risk. The strategy offers a way for advisors and investors to maintain tech exposure in their portfolios with added income and downside mitigation.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Howard Chan covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>And so, if you were income focused or dividend focused investor, and you want that income, generally you have to overweight a few common sectors. There are financials, utilities and energies, right? And you're underweight tech to get that dividend yield. And if you think about that, you're actually overweighting older parts of the economy, right? You used to be energy is the largest part of the Dow. Financial also was a very component, those are much smaller now. And then you're underweight the growth at part of the economy, right?</p>\n<p>Small cap is much more volatile. So, in the asset allocation, that's always a smaller part of your portfolio, right? So, you can't, you can't just allocate yourself out of a large cap. So, that's why we decided that downside mitigation is actually more important, because you have this core holding you have to hold for your risk exposure. And then maybe just, why do we think about using income as downside mitigation instead of buying protection, right? I personally have never really seen a tail risk hedging strategy that works.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So, we could have just did a basket of the six ETFs. But we actually went down back to the drawing board and say, if what is a strategy we want in our portfolio, right? We know the weaknesses of cover call strategies. We want the upside, but we also want the income. So, that's how we came to this dynamic waiting to, again, asymmetrically get the upside and then cushioned the downside for the strategy. Well, I think the strategy is, I mean, this is episode 54.</p>\n<p>So first of all, I forgot to mention in the 1520 names we actually re-balance quarterly, because we don't want short-term volatility to incur cost. So one of the things you might not be able to manage the market, but the one thing you can manage is the cost and the fund. So we want to minimize that. In terms of the momentum waiting, we do, again, we take a longer view. So, and when I mean that is, if this is an exposure that is going to be in your portfolio for 3 to 5 years, the shorter signal would be on a monthly basis, not on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>Yeah, that's also part of the design, right? So, so when I was a Goldman, I was actually the asset allocator for huge, huge funds to make decisions about asset allocation. So, let's start with essentially a 64 year portfolio, right? This would, would fit into obviously the large cap bucket, large cap growth. We think it would be good substitute for just a triple Q allocation. The reason why maybe we named it K triple Q, just for the downside mitigation, right?</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"So, that's why we decided that downside mitigation is actually more important, because you have this core holding you have to hold for your risk exposure.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d Howard Chan, founder of Kurv Investment Management, discussed his unique approach to ETFs and how his firm leverages institutional-grade strategies to benefit all investors.</li>\n<li>A key highlight of the conversation is Kurv\u2019s innovative technology-focused ETF, the KQQQ ETF (also referred to as \u201cKQs\u201d).</li>\n<li>This fund targets strategic exposure to the largest technology companies, aiming to deliver asymmetric upside while mitigating downside risk through dynamic covered call strategies.</li>\n<li>Chan explains that KQQQ is designed for investors who seek growth in technology but are also concerned about the sector\u2019s inherent volatility.</li>\n<li>The ETF combines momentum signals with a dynamic covered call strategy to capture upside during growth phases and generate income during periods of market correction or sideways trading.</li>\n<li>The fund dynamically overweights stocks showing positive momentum and deploys covered call strategies on those exhibiting negative momentum, creating a balanced approach that seeks to maximize returns while protecting against downside risk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Howard Chan highlights important considerations around income investing.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d Joanna Gallegos, co-founder of BondBloxx, shares her extensive background in ETFs and the innovative fixed income strategies her firm employs. Gallegos, who has been in the ETF industry her entire career, began at Barclays Global Investors during the early days of iShares before moving to JP Morgan to help start their ETF business. She co-founded BondBloxx in October 2021 with a team of experienced ETF professionals from firms like BlackRock, Vanguard, and JP Morgan, aiming to address the underdevelopment of fixed income products in the ETF market.</p>\n<h2>About Joanna Gallegos and BondBloxx</h2>\n<p>Gallegos explains that BondBloxx was created to bring more precision to fixed income investing through ETFs. The firm\u2019s product line focuses on high-yield sector and credit rating ETFs, offering a range of tools that allow investors to tailor their exposure more precisely. The company identified a gap in the market for more specific fixed income products, particularly in the high-yield space, where traditional broad market exposures were no longer sufficient for the evolving financial landscape.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>One of the standout products discussed is the BondBloxx CCC Rated US High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (ticker: XCCC). This ETF provides diversified exposure to over 220 bonds in the CCC rating category, which typically comprises about 10-11% of a broad high-yield index. Gallegos highlights that XCCC offers investors a significant yield pickup, with yields around 12%, and has shown impressive price appreciation in 2023. This ETF is designed to complement broad high-yield exposures by allowing investors to add a higher concentration of CCC-rated bonds, benefiting from their higher yields and potential price appreciation as interest rates decline.</p>\n<p>Gallegos addresses common misconceptions about CCC-rated bonds, emphasizing that the current market fundamentals for high-yield bonds are strong, and the overall default rates are not above historical norms. She explains that the diversified nature of XCCC, with hundreds of bonds, mitigates individual default risks and offers a more stable investment compared to picking individual high-yield bonds. The ETF\u2019s monthly rebalancing ensures it stays aligned with the ICE BofA CCC & Lower US High Yield Constrained Index, providing consistent exposure to the target credit rating.</p>\n<h2>Portfolio Construction and Implementation</h2>\n<p>For advisors and investors, Gallegos suggests that XCCC can be a valuable addition to an existing high-yield allocation, rather than a replacement. It allows investors to lean into the higher yield opportunities within the high-yield spectrum, especially in an environment where rates are expected to remain high for longer. This approach can enhance overall portfolio yield and performance, making XCCC a strategic tool for optimizing fixed income investments.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Joanna Gallegos covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>So you need to see more,\nbut we don't foresee our recession coming. And the second thing is,\nagain, going back to bond math\nand just giving some historical perspective on this,\nlike the coupon income\nhas been the primary driver of long-term returns\nin fixed income\nand specifically in high-yield. We have some data that shows\nthat it really has driven\nand absorbed\nin volatility\nin the high-yield segment. So in particular,\nwhen you have a 12%\nmillion-long yield within the portfolio,\nit can,\nit can weather price volatility,\nvery, very well.</p>\n<p>In 2023,\nit was the top performing category. If they think of it,\nit returned over 20%. And, you know,\nit's hard for people to create a relative sense of\nwhat's different about junk bonds\nand I try not to use that word. Today versus what they knew\nand what they're associating,\nthey're associating with, like,\nthe floor dropping out and everything going away. That could happen if you build up\nreally specific idiosyncratic risk\nand your portfolio with certain coupes\nand certain fundamentals,\nbut in certain, you know,\nsmaller size exposure to a triple seed.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>And this just hadn't been updated yet. So in high yield, we brought forward two things. So we brought seven industry sector products in high yield. And then we did three credit rating products. And so trading through the credit spectrum\nin credit in general, but in high yield,\nspecifically from WB all the way to triple C,\nis actually how institutional investors\nthink about their portfolios and where their risk is. And so we wanted to put all of these tools.</p>\n<p>And he called another co-founder at a bond block, his name's Brian O'Donnell and says, here we got to do this business. We've been talking about it at conferences over drinks for so long. But the way that markets are have been functioning and the role of ETFs specifically in fixed income is time. Like, do you want to do this? And so they made a couple more calls. And so there were seven of us that came together in October of 2021 to form a fixed income only ETF provider.</p>\n<p>So if you're buying a high yield ETF today,\nand you're getting the beta index exposure to that,\nyou're already exposed to about 10 percent triple Cs. And so what is interesting is, you know,\nfor someone that's using that in their allocation today,\nthis is a really great compliment to say,\nwell, maybe, you know, you should be adding\nanother slice of triple Cs adding more exposure\ninto your broad based high yield exposure. The yield has been bouncing around 12 percent all year.</p>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The firm\u2019s product line focuses on high-yield sector and credit rating ETFs, offering a range of tools that allow investors to tailor their exposure more precisely.</li>\n<li>This ETF provides diversified exposure to over 220 bonds in the CCC rating category, which typically comprises about 10-11% of a broad high-yield index.</li>\n<li>Gallegos highlights that XCCC offers investors a significant yield pickup, with yields around 12%, and has shown impressive price appreciation in 2023.</li>\n<li>This ETF is designed to complement broad high-yield exposures by allowing investors to add a higher concentration of CCC-rated bonds, benefiting from their higher yields and potential price appreciation as interest rates decline.</li>\n<li>She explains that the diversified nature of XCCC, with hundreds of bonds, mitigates individual default risks and offers a more stable investment compared to picking individual high-yield bonds.</li>\n<li>It allows investors to lean into the higher yield opportunities within the high-yield spectrum, especially in an environment where rates are expected to remain high for longer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Joanna Gallegos highlights important considerations around fixed income.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d Taylor Krystkowiak, co-founder of ThemesETFs, shared insights into his career and the innovative strategies behind ThemesETFs. Krystkowiak, who has worked at various firms ranging from Fortune 500 companies to boutique asset managers, brought his extensive experience in macroeconomic analysis and investment strategy to ThemesETFs. The firm, founded by Jose Gonzalez, focuses on providing thematic and fundamental investment strategies at competitive price points, offering a range of ETFs that cater to current market demands.</p>\n<h2>About Taylor Krystkowiak and ThemesETFs</h2>\n<p>ThemesETFs aims to differentiate itself by offering niche investment strategies at about 40% lower fees compared to the category average. Their first batch of ETFs includes sectors like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, cloud computing, banks, airlines, and European luxury brands. Krystkowiak emphasizes that their goal is to provide investors with targeted exposure to specific market sectors while minimizing fees to enhance overall portfolio performance. By offering a variety of investment options, ThemesETFs seeks to cater to investors\u2019 diverse needs and preferences.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>A focal point of the discussion was the Global Systematically Important Bank ETF (GSIB). GSIB targets the 28 globally systemically important banks, often referred to as \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d institutions. These banks are held to higher regulatory standards to ensure financial stability, making them more resilient during economic downturns. Krystkowiak highlights that GSIBs have outperformed other banks and the broader market, especially during rising interest rate environments. Since January 2022, GSIBs have shown a return of over 35%, compared to a 7% decline in the broader banking sector and modest gains in major indices.</p>\n<p>Krystkowiak explains that GSIB\u2019s success is attributed to their lower exposure to commercial real estate, higher capitalization, and better liquidity. These banks have also benefited from increased customer deposits and diversified income streams, such as investment banking and wealth management fees. With a quarterly rebalancing strategy, GSIB maintains an equal-weight exposure to all 28 banks on the Financial Stability Board\u2019s list, ensuring a balanced investment approach.</p>\n<h2>Portfolio Construction and Implementation</h2>\n<p>In terms of positioning within a portfolio, Krystkowiak suggests that GSIB can replace broad financial sector exposure or even serve as a core equity growth component. The ETF offers a way to diversify growth beyond tech-heavy names, providing stability and performance amidst market volatility. ThemesETFs employs a lean business model, utilizing artificial intelligence for efficient outreach and distribution, which allows them to offer lower fees to investors.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Taylor Krystkowiak covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>And we saw that this was an opportunity to lower that price point for investors, since we all know that over the course of the long run,\nthose fees are going to eat into your total returns. And in an environment where total market returns may be a little bit more muted going forward,\nand that's going to ultimately give you a windfall in the terms of the overall portfolio performance you can expect from some of the strategies,\nbut ultimately at the end of the day one of the things that we're trying to do is provide a menu of options of buffet bar of sorts.</p>\n<p>And then separately to your point, the other thing that we've tried to look and see if there are any novel strategies that have not been implemented yet,\nthat may have potential one of which will discuss it later today, but looking at a combination of both where existing assets are and where we might be able to offer a similar strategy at a lower price point,\nor offering a strategy that has not yet been brought to market because we believe that there is some credibility to that investment methodology that has potential for total return that may not yet be tabbed by current issuers.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>We're able to I think get in front of more people with fewer heads at our organization. So Taylor I really appreciate your time before I let you go where can people learn more about your ETFs and learn more about you. We are found on bingsetf.com so just as just like the mathematics themes ETFs.com is where you can find all of our ETFs more information about each one of the strategies top reasons to invest as well as the performance of the funds and their costs relative to the overall competition.</p>\n<p>Today we have on Taylor, Chris Koviac. And if you saw how that was spelled, you might be mildly impressed with me. He is from themes ETFs. We are talking about G-sib or G-S-I-B. They're global, systemically important bank ETFs. So think about too big to fail. There are 28 of those banks. We talk about the most recent performance of which it's done well. We talk about some of the systemic risk that are actually taken out of the portfolio by removing some of the commercial bank and regional exposures that are kind of in traditional financial ETFs.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"And when we put all of this together, what we really seen is that these banks are actually posting performance that is rivaling even the biggest tech stocks, magnificent seven stocks and many of which are actually up higher than those magnificent seven stocks.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"The IMF has labeled it as one of the biggest financial risks to stability and the thing that everyone I think fails to, I think really appreciate in terms of how the interest rate dynamic currently impacts.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The firm, founded by Jose Gonzalez, focuses on providing thematic and fundamental investment strategies at competitive price points, offering a range of ETFs that cater to current market demands.</li>\n<li>ThemesETFs aims to differentiate itself by offering niche investment strategies at about 40% lower fees compared to the category average.</li>\n<li>Krystkowiak emphasizes that their goal is to provide investors with targeted exposure to specific market sectors while minimizing fees to enhance overall portfolio performance.</li>\n<li>By offering a variety of investment options, ThemesETFs seeks to cater to investors\u2019 diverse needs and preferences.</li>\n<li>GSIB targets the 28 globally systemically important banks, often referred to as \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d institutions.</li>\n<li>The ETF offers a way to diversify growth beyond tech-heavy names, providing stability and performance amidst market volatility.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Taylor Krystkowiak highlights important considerations around quantitative investing.

So they're typically providing exposure\nvia swaps, which is a derivative contract that you procure from an investment bank and investment\nfor those providing with the leverage and via this stock contract to the funds. So\ncollateral, you have margin and you have a derivative contract that gives you that exposure. And all these funds rebalance at the end of each day.</p>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF. Behind the Ticker, uncovers the inner workings of the ETF industry. We will interview portfolio managers and ETF service providers to dive deep into their\nwork lives and their businesses. We will learn the inner workings of their strategies and what drives them as they continue\nto grow their company. Many of these individuals are entrepreneurs, and will have unique and compelling insights\nto share as much goes on behind the Ticker.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>Today we have Will Rind, he's the founder and CEO of Granite Shares. He is a very long and tenured career in the ETF business spanning over 20 years. He's worked on products like GLD, and went out and launched his own firm Granite Shares in 2017. They have grown quite significantly, and today we're going to talk about their single stock\nlevered ETF products with names like Tesla, Coinbase, and the video distribution and asset\ngrowth on these products has been very hot, so I think this conversation is very timely\nand also very interesting to get Will's perspective on the ETF space as a whole.</p>\n<p>In other words, the client never buys from us directly. What we see is\nthe net effect of all of the buys, all of the sales in the market on a given day and the residual\ncomes to us in the formula in order to create more shares or in order to cancel or redeem\nshares. So it's difficult, but I think it has to be a combination of the both. I mean,\nI looked yesterday, an NVDL was the best performing TF of the year so far, so it's done incredibly\nwell.</p>\n<p>So, anyway, think of Europe, we think of bonds,\nentity, but, is obviously when it comes to, to the, I mean, I saw a flow chart of far market\nversus the European market, and it is about as complex as it can get over there, comparison. I mean, don't get me wrong, people love UTS, it's just, there are just, there are just some\nfundamental challenges, which mean that the U.S. has accelerated, you know, far faster than anything\nin Europe, and, and, you know, some people say that Europe's like five years behind whether you\nexist, and it's probably one way or another.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"That's why we target the stated leverage\nfactor we call it, but that's why you'll see there's a amount of times in the case of\na lot of funds is different.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>His impressive journey includes a stint as a Principal at iShares and as a key member of the original European ETF team.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in income investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in crypto & digital assets relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Will Rhind highlights important considerations around crypto & digital assets.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d Tim Kramer, founder of CNIC Funds, shares his extensive background in the energy industry and the innovative approach behind CNIC\u2019s latest offering. Kramer, who has been in the energy sector since 1997, brings a wealth of experience from working with various energy companies and a private equity firm where he managed commodity exposure. This diverse background led him to identify a gap in the market: the lack of electricity in commodity indexes. To address this, Kramer and his team created the first-ever electricity index and subsequently launched the AMPD ETF (ticker: AMPD) in May 2023.</p>\n<h2>About Tim Kramer and CNIC Funds</h2>\n<p>Kramer explains that CNIC\u2019s electricity index is a groundbreaking development, given that electricity is the most consumed commodity in the U.S. but was previously absent from major commodity indexes like the Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM) and the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI). The AMPD ETF provides direct exposure to electricity futures, which are traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). By including electricity in an investable format, CNIC aims to offer investors a new way to diversify their portfolios and hedge against inflation, given electricity\u2019s significant impact on CPI and overall economic activity.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>One of the unique aspects of the AMPD ETF is its carbon-neutral status. Kramer elaborates on the use of carbon offsets in the fund, ensuring that its operations align with environmental sustainability goals. The ETF purchases carbon offsets corresponding to the electricity futures it holds, making it compliant with SFDR Article 8 standards in Europe. This approach not only addresses investor concerns about environmental impact but also positions the ETF as a forward-thinking product in the commodities market.</p>\n<p>Kramer also highlights the strategic and adaptive benefits of investing in the AMPD ETF. Strategically, it provides long-term exposure to the electrification of America, encompassing trends like AI, electric vehicles, and increased demand for renewable energy. Tactically, it offers a compelling investment due to current market conditions, where demand for electricity is rising, supply is constrained, and the grid\u2019s reliability is increasingly volatile. Moreover, the fund\u2019s structure, which parks a significant portion of its assets in three-month treasuries, allows investors to earn a risk-free rate while maintaining full notional exposure to electricity futures.</p>\n<h2>Portfolio Construction and Implementation</h2>\n<p>As CNIC Funds continues to grow, Kramer emphasizes their approach to marketing and distribution, focusing on partnerships with established platforms to leverage their exclusivity on the electricity index data. This strategy aims to maximize the fund\u2019s reach and capitalize on the unique market position of offering the first electricity-focused commodity ETF. For more information, investors can visit CNIC\u2019s website at CNICFunds.com, where they can access white papers, podcasts, and other educational resources about the AMPD ETF and the broader electricity market.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Tim Kramer covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>So let's talk about electricity. We have a lot of, I think you're the 50th episode. We've had everything from CLOs to stocks to bonds to ETFs to funds of funds. So this is the first electricity product. And a lot of financial advisors who listen to this\nprobably don't understand or know that electricity is even an investable universe. So can you talk about like at a high level, what are the main drivers that can affect the\nprice of electricity and how it can move up and down as time goes on?</p>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, chief investment officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF. Behind the Ticker, uncovers the inner workings of the ETF industry. We will interview portfolio managers and ETF service providers to dive deep into their\nwork lives and their businesses. We will learn the inner workings of their strategies and what drives them as they continue\nto grow their company. Many of these individuals are entrepreneurs, and will have unique and compelling insights\nto share as much goes on behind the Ticker.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>One would be what we would say strategic, excuse me. So this strategic reason\nwould be why do you want to buy this and hold it forever. And then the second reason would be\nadaptive, which is like, why do you want to buy it now? So for the strategic, like, why do you want\nto buy and hold it forever? If you take a look, and for the longest time, model portfolio is\nworth 60, 40. So 60% stock, 40% bonds.</p>\n<p>And there's the whole, you know, we'll say reliability\nissue. The second thing is, when you buy AMP, to me you're basically buying futures that we\npackage for you and ETF, if you buy a hundred dollars worth of futures, $15 goes to your broker\nto support the trade is margin. The other 85% at the 85 dollars goes into basically three month\ntreasures. So you get paid the risk free rate to hold this position as you wait for the\nfundamentals to unfold.</p>\n<p>If you bought a company that mined gold, well, you don't know if a hedge or didn't hedge and\nthey've got operating expenses and overhead. So you're not getting a real pure play on the\ncommodity if you buy the equity. So you're buying the equity for a different reason. Maybe it's a dividend or something else. So that same logic exists when you talk about electricity. So there's, you can buy stocks and companies that are called IPPs independent power producers\nwhere you can buy utility stocks.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"So which we said,\nokay, we want the biggest, baddest, best meteorologist we could find.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"Once going to appreciate the opportunity\nbecause as you know, when you're starting up your own ETF like this, it's a difficult endeavor.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The AMPD ETF provides direct exposure to electricity futures, which are traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).</li>\n<li>By including electricity in an investable format, CNIC aims to offer investors a new way to diversify their portfolios and hedge against inflation, given electricity\u2019s significant impact on CPI and overall economic activity.</li>\n<li>One of the unique aspects of the AMPD ETF is its carbon-neutral status.</li>\n<li>The ETF purchases carbon offsets corresponding to the electricity futures it holds, making it compliant with SFDR Article 8 standards in Europe.</li>\n<li>Strategically, it provides long-term exposure to the electrification of America, encompassing trends like AI, electric vehicles, and increased demand for renewable energy.</li>\n<li>Tactically, it offers a compelling investment due to current market conditions, where demand for electricity is rising, supply is constrained, and the grid\u2019s reliability is increasingly volatile.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Tim Kramer highlights important considerations around energy.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d Meb Faber, CEO and CIO of Cambria Investments, shares insights into his career journey and the innovative investment strategies employed by his firm. Faber, who has a background in engineering and biotech, founded Cambria Investments and has led the firm to manage approximately $2.5 billion in assets. Based in Manhattan Beach, California, Cambria is known for its quantitative, rules-based investment approach. Over the past decade, the firm has launched 15 funds, attracting over 150,000 investors worldwide.</p>\n<h2>About Meb Faber and Cambria Investments</h2>\n<p>Faber emphasizes Cambria\u2019s commitment to launching funds that fill gaps in the market. The firm\u2019s investment philosophy revolves around creating ETFs that either don\u2019t exist or are implemented significantly better or cheaper than existing options. This approach has led to the development of a diverse range of ETFs, all backed by substantial academic and practitioner research. Faber\u2019s passion for educating investors is evident through Cambria\u2019s free research service, the Idea Farm, which curates valuable investment insights for over 100,000 subscribers.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>A significant portion of the discussion centers around Cambria\u2019s Shareholder Yield ETFs, particularly SYLD, which focuses on U.S. stocks. Shareholder yield goes beyond traditional dividend yield by incorporating net stock buybacks, providing a more comprehensive measure of a company\u2019s return to shareholders. Faber explains that the methodology behind these ETFs includes screening for companies with high shareholder yield, favorable valuation metrics, and strong financial health. The final selection process also considers intermediate-term momentum to avoid value traps.</p>\n<p>The Shareholder Yield ETFs, including SYLD, FYLD (foreign developed markets), and EYLD (emerging markets), are designed to offer investors high-quality, cash-generating businesses at attractive valuations. These funds aim to provide superior risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional dividend-focused strategies. Faber highlights the current undervaluation of international and emerging market stocks, making them attractive investments given their potential for significant returns.</p>\n<h2>Portfolio Construction and Implementation</h2>\n<p>Faber also touches on Cambria\u2019s trend-following strategies, which serve as a premier diversifier in portfolios. These strategies have proven effective during market downturns, offering protection and opportunities for gains in various market conditions. The firm continues to innovate and expand its ETF offerings, guided by the principle of creating products that Faber and his team would invest in themselves. For more information about Cambria and its range of ETFs, investors can visit CambriaFunds.com.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Meb Faber covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>Today we have on Clark Allen, he's the head of ETFs at Horizon Investments. We talk about the firm, we talk about their two ETFs that they just launched, but we are\nmostly focusing today on BenJ, which is BENJ, the Horizon Landmark ETF, which is really\na cast management strategy using box spreads. It's offering a T-Bill plus like return, but the kicker is it is not kicking off income. So we talk about that strategy. We also briefly touch on HBTA and the firm's plans to launch more product.</p>\n<p>And so that helps you stomach the volatility\nthat you are probably taking on with the equity risk that you likely need to have a high probability\nsuccess. But with a high liquidity bucket, if you just ignore the fact that you're getting volatility\nin your equity portfolio, or even equity fixed income mix, and just focus on your liquidity bucket,\nthat's going to be able to provide you the spending you need to meet your needs. And so this is\nan ETF that's designed specifically to fit that liquidity bucket.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>It can be similar, white label and additional costs that comes with that. We have hired a trading sub advisor to allow us to scale pretty quickly because we've\ntraded mutual funds, we've traded resumes, but there's a lot more to trading ETFs in terms\nof the in-kind process, the APs dealing with the market makers, the exchange, and there's\na lot of different other pieces that we work familiar with. And so coming to market with this many ETFs, let's just, we said, let's just partner\nwith somebody that's really good and we'll come up with the strategy, we'll come up with\nthe distribution, and we'll let them do the trading and execution on our behalf.</p>\n<p>And so we've launched a custom portfolio business, which is custom estimates, attack management. And then even more recently, now we've launched our first two ETFs, and we just filed for\nseven more, and there will be more to come this year where we're coming pretty quickly\ninto the Active ETF space, and simply because we see that there's a need. And again, we have solutions, and we see that there's gaps in those solutions that are offering\nadvisors, and we want to be able to have product to fill those needs and really serve these\nadvisors.</p>\n<p>And so I came here originally was just focused on the point research, the director of\ncontent research, portfolio management as well. And then more recently we've entered the ETF space and so it was promoted ahead of ETFs\nand overseeing not just sort of research efforts, but also execution and launching of our\nETF business. It's funny, you and I have fairly similar backgrounds. I did public accounting, but I was on the tax side and I lasted about one tax season and\nit was like that's enough for me.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"But ETFs have really been at the core of everything, and that's why we sell advise ETFs\nfor first trust, and it's really what's given us is the confidence that come to market\nwith so many ETFs this year, because we understand how ETFs work.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Faber emphasizes Cambria\u2019s commitment to launching funds that fill gaps in the market.</li>\n<li>A significant portion of the discussion centers around Cambria\u2019s Shareholder Yield ETFs, particularly SYLD, which focuses on U.S.</li>\n<li>The Shareholder Yield ETFs, including SYLD, FYLD (foreign developed markets), and EYLD (emerging markets), are designed to offer investors high-quality, cash-generating businesses at attractive valuations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Meb Faber highlights important considerations around fixed income.

McHugh, who began his career at Merrill Lynch in 1988 and later joined Oppenheimer and Wells Fargo Advisors, eventually founded WealthTrust in 2015. His motivation stemmed from a desire to manage portfolios on a discretionary basis and offer superior performance, which he has successfully achieved with WealthTrust\u2019s long-term growth portfolio outperforming the S&P 500 65% of the time since 2000.</p>\n<h2>About John McHugh and WealthTrust Asset Management</h2>\n<p>WealthTrust Asset Management provides a wide range of portfolio management services across six turnkey asset management platforms. The firm manages 12 different strategies, including small-cap, mid-cap, fixed income, and large-cap portfolios, as well as two balanced portfolios. WealthTrust is notable for its GIPS (Global Investment Performance Standards) compliance, a testament to its rigorous performance measurement and presentation standards. McHugh emphasizes the firm\u2019s commitment to educating advisors and their clients through webinars and collaborative presentations, highlighting the importance of understanding their investment methodology.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>A significant focus of the podcast was on WealthTrust\u2019s flagship ETF, WLTG (WealthTrust Long-Term Growth ETF). This ETF employs a growth-at-reasonable-price strategy, competing with benchmarks like the Russell 1000 but with a stronger growth orientation. McHugh detailed the rigorous screening process used to identify companies with high-quality earnings and dividends, aiming to construct a portfolio of 25 to 30 large-cap and mega-cap stocks. The selection process relies heavily on quantitative analysis, including earnings quality, dividend quality, and quantitative rankings that signal the likelihood of companies beating earnings estimates.</p>\n<p>In addition to its fundamental analysis, WLTG incorporates an AI-driven momentum overlay, which enhances the portfolio\u2019s performance by identifying stocks with strong momentum. This dual approach allows WealthTrust to dynamically adjust its holdings based on market trends, ensuring the portfolio remains well-positioned for growth while managing risk. McHugh highlighted the flexibility of the ETF to shift between growth and value stocks and even include passive ETFs or defensive assets like treasuries and gold during market downturns.</p>\n<h2>Portfolio Construction and Implementation</h2>\n<p>WealthTrust\u2019s innovative approach to portfolio management and the WLTG ETF provides a compelling option for advisors and investors seeking to enhance their large-cap growth exposure. McHugh\u2019s extensive experience and commitment to rigorous analysis and education underscore the firm\u2019s dedication to delivering superior investment solutions. For more information about WealthTrust and their ETF offerings, visit their websites at WealthTrustETF.com and WealthTrustAM.com.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and John McHugh covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>So, it allows us, that's what we did in 2022. We identified when it was time to get\nout of growth, and put some more investments into value. So, we sold a lot of these ETFs that\n25 percent of these passive ETFs and bought value ETFs in depth to a important time. So,\nthe Russell 1000 growth, I think, was down 38 percent in 2022. And we were done significantly less\nthan that because of our move from growth to value.</p>\n<p>And it's still a four the day before we will sell it. 99% of the time, that results in us missing\nor actually only having, let's look at the other way. Our earnings be 95% of the time with the market\nonly beats 75% of the time. Like I said, we look at companies\nthat we think have good growth potential to them. Have somewhat of a dividend. And the quantity\nof analysis helps us have lower standard deviation. Our downside risk factor is, I was just\nlooking at our larger growth portfolio, our downside risk factor is 0.85 on the downside downcatcher.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>Well, I mean, John, I think, you know,\nthe investment advisors that are listening this and model portfolio providers,\nthat this product, I think, is a great compliment to just traditional large cab growth exposure. I don't think it's just a small account solution. There's a lot of people that are running\nETF only. Model portfolios are delivering to tamps. And I think this would be a great compliment\nto help drive some alpha. And that large cab growth bucket is their building portfolios.</p>\n<p>No, it depends what the market's doing. For example, in 2022, our trend analysis program told us to go from growth to add some value\ninto it. And so we are actually taking some trades off of, we had some of the max 7s,\ndifferent than 7s in our portfolio, they do very well in 2001. So but in 2022, we actually took\nsome money off of that and start bailed banks and value. So in 2022 is smart to do some trades.</p>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, chief investment officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF.

This quantitative approach allows Bancreek to identify companies with unique competitive advantages, such as robust distribution pipelines, significant brand equity, and strong network effects, which can sustain growth and compounding over long periods.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>Bancreek has launched two ETFs to bring their investment strategy to a broader audience: BCUS, which focuses on US large-cap companies, and BCIL, which targets international large-cap companies excluding the US. Both ETFs are constructed using a proprietary ranking system that identifies and weights approximately 30 top businesses based on their structural advantages. This methodology aims to provide investors with a diversified portfolio of high-quality, growth-oriented companies. The ETFs are refreshed monthly to ensure they reflect the latest data and insights from Bancreek\u2019s quantitative models.</p>\n<p>Skatoff also discusses the challenges and opportunities of entering the ETF market. He emphasizes that Bancreek\u2019s unique value proposition lies in its ability to apply quantitative analysis to long-term investing, differentiating it from other short-term or momentum-driven strategies. To promote their ETFs, Bancreek focuses on education and transparency, offering data visualization tools and resources on their website to help investors understand their investment process. By engaging with advisors and attending industry conferences, Bancreek aims to build awareness and demonstrate the potential of their innovative approach to portfolio management.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Andrew Skatoff covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, chief investment officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d Danielle Gilbert, head of business development at Panagram, discusses her career path and the innovative structured credit solutions offered by Panagram. Gilbert began her career in structured credit at UBS and spent 18 years on the sell side. In that role, she met the investment team at Eldridge. Panagram provides a deep dive into the complexities and benefits of structured credit and CLOs (collateralized loan obligations). Panagram, launched in 2021, leverages its expertise in structured credit to offer institutional-grade investment strategies to a broader audience through ETFs.</p>\n<h2>About Danielle Gilbert and Panagram</h2>\n<p>Gilbert explains that structured credit involves creating diversified pools of contractual cash flows from various assets like mortgages, credit cards, and corporate loans. CLOs, a subset of structured credit, bundle senior secured loans from large corporations into different tranches of bonds with varying risk levels. These tranches, ranging from AAA to equity, offer investors tailored risk and return profiles. Unlike the subprime mortgage products that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis, CLOs are backed by higher quality, senior secured loans with historically low default rates and high recovery rates.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>Panagram manages about $17 billion in assets, with more than half invested in CLOs. Their investment approach focuses on high-quality CLO managers and active management to optimize returns. Gilbert highlights that CLOs offer floating rate exposure, providing a hedge against rising interest rates and adding diversification to fixed income portfolios. The two ETFs Panagram launched in 2023, CLOZ and CLOX, provide different levels of exposure to CLO tranches. CLOZ focuses on BBB and BB tranches, offering higher yields around 9%, while CLOX targets AAA tranches for more conservative investors.</p>\n<p>Gilbert emphasizes the importance of education in promoting these products to advisors and individual investors unfamiliar with structured credit. Panagram\u2019s strategy includes educational seminars, webinars, and one-on-one discussions to demystify CLOs and highlight their benefits in portfolio diversification and income generation. By providing access to institutional-grade CLO investments through ETFs, Panagram aims to offer investors better yield opportunities with strong historical performance and lower correlation to traditional fixed income and equity markets.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Danielle Gilbert covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>And they're putting that into like an income portfolio. And they set that as their baseline and then they adjust it as they see fit,\nbased on their views on where credit risk is. And then I've seen investors that are more conservative\nthat really want 100% exposure to just pure play, CLO triple A's. Now, I don't know if you're familiar with this step,\nbut there are 10 CLO ETFs in the market today. The first one was created in October of 2020.</p>\n<p>It could be a third component we talked about yield resilience,\nbut third is just less correlated. And that's both triple B, double B risk and the triple A risk. We've seen, listen, I've seen it allocated in a lot of different ways. So I've seen investors use CLO Z as a high yield replacement. So that could be either high yield, traditional high yield,\nor they're replacing their loan exposure and getting exposed to an triple B double B. But I've also seen an investors do a barbell approach\nwhere they maybe have 50% exposure to CLO Z and 50% exposure to CLO X.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>But it was actually, well, time because that market has grown to what it is today, which\nis very institutional, but I had a front seat to that growth. So my role was, as a salesperson, covering portfolio managers, sophisticated portfolio managers,\nthat had pools of capital that they were allocating to structured credit. So I was in pre-GFC, during the GFC post, along career in that type of opportunity of settling\nand covering those types of sophisticated clients. Now, it was in that role that I met the panogram team, so they were working at Eldridge,\ninvesting capital on behalf of Eldridge and the affiliated balance sheet.</p>\n<p>So the 10 largest stocks in the index by market capitalization, which is mostly obviously\nthe tech giants, have posted a median gain of 17%, while the rest have lost 1.3%. So on the equity side, you're already pretty heavily indexed to a few names, but then\non the fixed income side, I think what's happening just to relate it back to that is\nyou're heavily indexed to duration risk. Most of the 40% is fixed rate. And I think a lot of people have been getting off sides for not only because of the increased\ncorrelation because they've been taking on, look at we saw the regional banks.</p>\n<p>So, Panogram is a specialized structured credit asset manager. They manage about 17 billion in assets, 16.8, rounding up, and more than half of that\nis in CLO related investments. We're big investors in CLO bonds and CLO equity. We're not a CLO manager, it's very important distinction. We actually specialize in investing in the management of CLO, so the structure. And the team, the investment team has been working together since 2014. They first started when Eldridge was being formed, managing the assets for Eldridge and\nthe affiliates.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"We're just new to the outside world, so I jumped on the opportunity and started when\nwe pretty much launched in 2021 to that side of the world in the fall of 2021.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"And the whole point was, you can learn anything, even complex things, you can teach yourself,\nit's available, and it was actually a big hit.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Panagram provides a deep dive into the complexities and benefits of structured credit and CLOs (collateralized loan obligations).</li>\n<li>Their investment approach focuses on high-quality CLO managers and active management to optimize returns.</li>\n<li>CLOZ focuses on BBB and BB tranches, offering higher yields around 9%, while CLOX targets AAA tranches for more conservative investors.</li>\n<li>Gilbert emphasizes the importance of education in promoting these products to advisors and individual investors unfamiliar with structured credit.</li>\n<li>By providing access to institutional-grade CLO investments through ETFs, Panagram aims to offer investors better yield opportunities with strong historical performance and lower correlation to traditional fixed income and equity markets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Danielle Gilbert highlights important considerations around fixed income.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \u201cBehind the Ticker,\u201d Yang Tang, co-founder of Arch Indices, discusses his career journey and the innovative approach his firm takes in constructing investment portfolios. With a background in commodity sales and macro solutions at major financial institutions like Barclays, Morgan Stanley, and Citi, Tang brings a wealth of experience to Arch Indices. The firm, founded in August 2022, aims to build better portfolios through a unique methodology focused on risk-adjusted contributions, departing from traditional market cap or equal-weighted strategies.</p>\n<h2>About Yang Tang and Arch Indicies</h2>\n<p>Tang explains the core principles behind Arch Indices\u2019 approach, which revolves around variance optimization, a concept rooted in modern portfolio theory. This methodology emphasizes creating portfolios that achieve specific investment goals, such as income generation or total return, with the least amount of volatility. Unlike traditional methods that rely on expected returns, Arch Indices uses market-observed volatility and correlation to dynamically adjust portfolios. Their recursive optimization technique further refines this process, continually adjusting asset allocations to maximize returns while minimizing risk.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>One of the standout products from Arch Indices is their ETF, VWI (Arch Indices Income ETF), which combines dividend-paying stocks and bond ETFs to deliver high income with low volatility. The ETF aims to provide investors with the highest possible income while minimizing fluctuations in portfolio value. Tang highlights the dynamic nature of the ETF, which rebalances quarterly to adapt to changing market conditions, ensuring that the portfolio remains optimized for both yield and risk. This approach allows the ETF to maintain a high yield, typically around 6.8%, while keeping volatility low.</p>\n<p>Tang discusses the practical applications of the VWI ETF for different types of investors. He notes that the ETF is particularly well-suited for retirement-focused advisors and individuals, offering a stable income stream with lower volatility, which is crucial for managing sequence of returns risk in retirement planning. Additionally, the ETF can serve as a core holding within a broader portfolio, providing a foundation of income and stability while allowing for the inclusion of other growth-oriented assets. Tang also mentions that Arch Indices offers the strategy through SMAs via a partnership with Quorus, catering to clients who prefer a more tailored approach.</p>\n<h2>Portfolio Construction and Implementation</h2>\n<p>Overall, Tang emphasizes the importance of staying invested and managing risk effectively, particularly in volatile markets. The VWI ETF and Arch Indices\u2019 broader strategy provide a robust solution for investors seeking to balance income generation with risk management. The firm\u2019s innovative approach to portfolio construction, rooted in rigorous mathematical optimization, sets it apart in the competitive ETF landscape.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Yang Tang covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF.

We will learn the inner workings of their strategies and what drives them as they continue\nto grow their company. Many of these individuals are entrepreneurs, and will have unique and compelling insights\nto share as much goes on behind the Ticker.</p>\n<p>And the genesis of what we do is pretty much all pass the portfolios out there,\nare either market cap or, and if you think about this, historically market cap was actually\nnegative, I factor, right? If you look at that to research, small caps are thrown out perform large caps over a long period\nof times. Of course, the last 70 years is not a good example of that, but nonetheless,\nthe way people try to correct for that is to look at people.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So what you want is you want a lot of assets that have extremely high yield relative to its\nunderlying volatility. So that doesn't mean that you want 26% dividend pay stocks, right? You want\nsay something that has high yield, but also extremely low volatility. And the second is the second\nlayer of defense is looking for assets that don't move together. So of the 600 available stocks,\nI'm going to need to get a moment on the low end.</p>\n<p>So in that may reap balance\nas an interesting point, it's almost 50% between bond ETFs and BDCs. And that's actually\nquite noticeable because number one, correlation between stocks and bonds have been dropped in\nall year, and bond volatility actually declined by after. Whereas if you look at kind of our\nOctober rebalance last year, even though yields on 30 year bonds probably hit gosh decade high in\nOctober, it actually did increase its allocation to bond ETFs. So, because that increase\nin yield came with an increase in volatility.</p>\n<p>So we try to, yes, close to the, you know, I guess the broad investment bond index\nfor dollars. So it's going to be, you know, the different duration sectors of both ICHE\ncorporates as well as US government bonds. We do have AAA CLOs. So yes, we do have security\nas product exposure. We have mortgage back exposure as well. So we only\nhave actually eight or nine bond ETFs in the moment. And then we try to, we just try to capture\nas much of the dollar bond investment universe as we can from a pure sector approach.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"If you bought in March and then you went through\nprobably three more phases of volatility over the summer of 2020, 2021, you know,\nprobably the biggest debt hike.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The firm, founded in August 2022, aims to build better portfolios through a unique methodology focused on risk-adjusted contributions, departing from traditional market cap or equal-weighted strategies.</li>\n<li>This methodology emphasizes creating portfolios that achieve specific investment goals, such as income generation or total return, with the least amount of volatility.</li>\n<li>One of the standout products from Arch Indices is their ETF, VWI (Arch Indices Income ETF), which combines dividend-paying stocks and bond ETFs to deliver high income with low volatility.</li>\n<li>The ETF aims to provide investors with the highest possible income while minimizing fluctuations in portfolio value.</li>\n<li>This approach allows the ETF to maintain a high yield, typically around 6.8%, while keeping volatility low.</li>\n<li>Tang also mentions that Arch Indices offers the strategy through SMAs via a partnership with Quorus, catering to clients who prefer a more tailored approach.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Yang Tang highlights important considerations around fixed income.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \"Behind the Ticker,\" Burke Ashenden, Head of Capital Markets at Innovator ETFs, delves into the unique offerings of Innovator ETFs with host Brad. Ashenden, who started his career in ETF trading and later transitioned to the issuer side, shares his journey and how it led him to Innovator. Innovator ETFs, founded by industry veterans Bruce Bond and John Souther, focuses exclusively on Defined Outcome ETFs. This singular focus has made Innovator a leader in this niche, with a variety of products designed to offer downside protection and defined outcomes for investors.Ashenden explains the core concept behind Innovator's Defined Outcome ETFs, which provide a buffer against market losses in exchange for a cap on upside gains. These ETFs are constructed using a basket of flex options, which offer customizable tenors and strikes, allowing for precise defined outcomes. The firm offers various buffers, including a 9%, 15%, and 30% buffer against market losses over different periods, such as quarterly or annually. Additionally, Innovator has expanded its offerings with 100% buffer ETFs, providing complete downside protection, which has been particularly appealing to advisors and investors looking to equitize cash without principal risk.The conversation highlights the practical applications of these ETFs. Ashenden emphasizes their utility in different market environments, particularly for conservative clients or those wary of investing at market highs. The ETFs' ability to reset within the structure without triggering taxable events and their flexibility make them an attractive alternative to traditional fixed income, especially in a high-yield, low-tax environment. Ashenden points out that these products can be effectively used as a conservative equity allocation or even as a fixed income alternative, providing attractive caps with full downside protection.Ashenden also discusses the strategic use of Innovator's model portfolios, which combine different Defined Outcome ETFs to create customized risk-return profiles. These models help advisors implement diversified and risk-managed portfolios. He underscores the benefits of Innovator's tools available on their website, which assist advisors in analyzing potential outcomes and historical performance. Innovator ETFs' commitment to Defined Outcome strategies and their innovative approach to structured products make them a compelling choice for advisors looking to navigate volatile markets with confidence.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Burke Ashenden covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>So but it's not a one-to-one. So if I'm an advisor buying this product,\nand I am looking to cap the S&P exposure at 9%,\nwith 100% downside protection,\nand the market moves up 9% in the first month in January. I'm not going to actually make 9% in the ETF,\nthat Nav is not going to move up 9%. And that's because of the time value of the option\nis that correct? You can expect a lag in superior. So the Defined Outcome is realized at the end of the outcome period.</p>\n<p>So people love that idea of principle protection for their investment. And you can think about FIAs. You can think about annuities. Those spaces have been growing significantly as well over the past two years. So principally protected structures is what we were trying to target with this. And we resolved in a couple of problems. The first is cash on the sidelines. We talked to a lot of advisors. And they tell us that around 30% of the portfolio right now\nis in cash light or cash ETFs.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>I'm just going to keep throwing stats at you. The market is over its skis. And I think people a little concerned. The advisors we talk to are concerned about investing\nat all-time highs in equities. So this is a perfect solution for those very conservative clients. Those retirees, those pre-retirees,\nto aquatize that cash. So if I'm a model portfolio provider,\nand I'm looking to create risk-managed portfolios. Let's say something off of a 70, 30, a 60, 40,\nor even, let's call it a 30, 70.</p>\n<p>And my clients are in the growth stage of their life. They don't need the income. Isn't there also, could there be an argument\nthat you could utilize some of these as a fixed income\nand volatility dampener in an overall portfolio\nrather than having to rely on the fixed income markets\nto reduce some standard deviation volatility\nMost definitely. The use cases are numerous. It could be a conservative equity allocation. But with a 9% cap on the S&P over one year,\nthat's above the average S&P return when you look historically.</p>\n<p>They need a more upside, they juice their bonds\nfor everything they could,\nso they use buffers as a solution there. So we're starting to see that continue\ndespite the higher rates,\nthe caps that we have right now in these products,\nare really compelling. A 9% cap over one year has definitely garnered a lot\nof attention in the marketplace. So what would the difference between a one year\nand a two year, 100% of or is there an advantage\nof using a two over a one?</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"But if you had to know the really simple breakdown,\nit's buffers.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"It's a basket of options, is what it is at the end of the day.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In a recent episode of \"Behind the Ticker,\" Burke Ashenden, Head of Capital Markets at Innovator ETFs, delves into the unique offerings of Innovator ETFs with host Brad.</li>\n<li>The firm offers various buffers, including a 9%, 15%, and 30% buffer against market losses over different periods, such as quarterly or annually.</li>\n<li>Ashenden emphasizes their utility in different market environments, particularly for conservative clients or those wary of investing at market highs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Burke Ashenden highlights important considerations around fixed income.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \"Behind the Ticker,\" Jerry Parker, founder of Chesapeake Capital an industry veteran in trend following and systematic trading, shares his professional journey and insights into the systematic investing approach that defines Chesapeake. Parker's career transition from accounting to trading was catalyzed by his training under Richard Dennis in the famous \"turtle trading\" program, which profoundly shaped his investment philosophy. His foundational experience at Dennis's training program led him to establish Chesapeake Capital, where he has dedicated his career to refining and applying systematic trend-following strategies.Parker elaborates on the philosophy of trend-following, emphasizing its reliance on strict system rules and objective price data to drive trading decisions. This method contrasts sharply with more subjective or discretionary trading approaches, relying on historical price actions to guide future trading decisions, aiming to capitalize on market trends irrespective of market conditions. This disciplined adherence to system rules, according to Parker, allows traders to manage risk effectively and achieve consistent performance over time.In discussing Chesapeake's operations, Parker highlights the firm's evolution towards offering ETFs and mutual funds that democratize access to trend-following strategies, previously the preserve of institutional investors. The ETF, symbolized as TFPN, encapsulates Chesapeake's commitment to pure trend-following, applying this strategy across a broad array of markets including commodities, currencies, and equities both domestically and internationally. Parker's passion for trend-following is evident as he advocates for its effectiveness in managing portfolio risks and capturing market trends.Parker concludes by reflecting on the broader implications of systematic trend-following for portfolio management. He suggests that while Chesapeake's strategies can serve as core portfolio components due to their comprehensive market coverage and disciplined risk management, investors often incorporate them as supplementary allocations to diversify and stabilize existing portfolios. His insights underscore the adaptability and enduring relevance of trend-following in the dynamic world of investment management.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Jerry Parker covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>So since our goal and our whole reason for existing is to\ncut down these outlier trades and capture these things and allow a small percentage of the overall\ntrades to make all the money and pay for all the small losing trades, we really don't want to take\ncorrelation too seriously because as we've seen historically the markets are individual and\nthey can do their own thing and have these videos and credit moves. So the ETF and the portfolio does a fantastic job of drawdown mitigation.</p>\n<p>So we have all this diversification and all\nthese different kind of stocks, long and short, half the portfolio. The other half the portfolio is\nmade up of the currencies, the commodities and the bond futures. And we have some bond ETFs,\nsome of the exposure to the bond markets that you don't get in futures, we pick those up in ETFs,\nlike job bonds, mortgage backs, tips, corporate, duties, things like that. So we're just searching\nthe world over for securities, for futures and trying to create this amazingly diverse portfolio.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>And so we're some sort of the managed futures marketing is usually something like, please add us\nto your portfolio, a 5% or 10% allocation to your stock and bond portfolio, to for crisis alpha,\nto mitigate the times where stocks are really bad and have a big sell-off. We're like,\nhey, there's a more direct approach. Let's trend follow the actual stocks and not rely upon\nthe small allocation. I mean, our allocation will probably small anyways. But we sort of say,\nlet's get at this as quickly as possible and wrap around equities themselves, stop losses,\ntrading stops, small losses, all the benefits and the risk management trend following has\nand pick up all this extra diversification that single stocks can give you that you don't get\nfrom indices, like right now every index, every stock index future is long and all around the\nworld.</p>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \"Behind the Ticker,\" Bob Elliott, founder of Unlimited and former employee at Bridgewater Associates, shares insights into his journey and the innovative approach his firm takes in the hedge fund industry. Elliott's experience at Bridgewater and overseeing a venture fund shaped his understanding of the limitations of traditional hedge fund fees, leading him to create Unlimited. The firm leverages modern machine learning to replicate hedge fund strategies at lower costs, making these strategies accessible and tax-efficient for a broader audience.Elliott discusses the potential of hedge fund strategies when stripped of exorbitant fees. He explains that these strategies typically offer solid returns with lower volatility compared to the equity market, but the traditional fee structure significantly dampens their attractiveness. At Unlimited, Elliott aims to harness these strategies' intrinsic value through a low-cost, diversified indexing approach that mimics the broad hedge fund market without the typical fee burden.The podcast delves into Unlimited's flagship ETF, HFND, which embodies the firm's philosophy of making hedge fund returns accessible. Elliott describes the ETF's construction using a machine learning model that analyzes current hedge fund manager positions to replicate their strategies. This model ensures the ETF reflects an accurate, up-to-date representation of the hedge fund landscape. Through this innovative approach, Unlimited not only democratizes access to hedge fund strategies but also enhances transparency and tax efficiency for investors.Elliott concludes the discussion by emphasizing the importance of including hedge fund-like strategies within diversified portfolios, suggesting a blend of such strategies can significantly enhance risk-adjusted returns. He envisions HFND as a core component of investors' alternative allocations, ideally complementing other investment strategies within a well-rounded portfolio. The conversation highlights Elliott's commitment to breaking down the barriers to sophisticated investment strategies, making them accessible to investors of all scales.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Bob Elliott covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>Today we have on Bob Elliott from Unlimited, and we are talking about their multi-strategy\nreturn tracker ETF, Ticker HFND. It takes all the different facets of hedge funds and combines them into a single index,\nand looks to track their return profiles, the use machine learning in order to build a\nprobabilistic asset allocation that will mirror multi-strategy hedge fund performance,\nand they package it all up in a nice cost-efficient way. So I think you will find this conversation extremely interesting with Mr.</p>\n<p>And so there is a real craft in between my co-founder\nand I we have almost 50 years of experience in this business, building head proprietary hedge funds\nstrategies and that that shows in how and that is in critically important terms of how we build\nthe approaches. But from that craft, what we do is we build a systematic process that is running\non a day-to-day basis, taking in manager performance information, asset return information,\nallocation information and basically saying given that set of information in the sort of decision\nrules and design that we've created, what is the highest probabilistic portfolio that's describing\nthe returns that we're seeing in the most recent period.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>And so, what is it about hedge fund\nreturn profiles that investors find appealing? We hear a lot about hedge funds and this shows tailored\nto financial advisors in RIA. So, what is it about that hedge fund return profile and the risk\nreturn of them that makes them appealing or that they should be a part of more of a diversified portfolio? Well, I think for most people, they look at, they can look at, say, net returns, indices and\nthey certainly aren't screaming off the chart that that's something that you want in your portfolio.</p>\n<p>In many ways, I'm benefited,\nand many products are benefited from his more than a decade of pushing and bringing these\nideas to the forefront for the benefit of investors. Managed futures, you could just think about\nmanaged futures just one hedge fund strategy that exists. Out there in the market, there's a lot\nof different hedge fund strategies, equity-long short, global macro, fixed income strategies,\nmanagers that are focused on the emerging markets, maybe event-focused M&A type strategies\nthat are out there.</p>\n<p>Well, functionally, if you think about\nthere's five trillion dollars of assets and hedge funds, basically what that means is that\nhedge funds are invested in or exposed to the 70-ish largest liquid markets in the world. And so our opportunity set is essentially the 70-ish largest liquid markets in the world. And that may adjust over time as certain markets emerge and others no longer are as large. But in general, that opportunity set exists through time and then we just express those views\nin them in what we believe to be the most efficient security possible, whether it's in ETFs\nor cash equities or futures in any cases.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"And the challenge with most of those approaches is that they're\noften adding to the fee problem, rather than increasing access and reducing the fee problem.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"And that's why I've found at least in my years of gardening that much\nmuch better to plant a whole bunch of different stuff and see what comes and take joy in that\nand not stress too much about, you know, hoping to get one particular plant or one particular crop to\ncome out the way you'd like.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>He explains that these strategies typically offer solid returns with lower volatility compared to the equity market, but the traditional fee structure significantly dampens their attractiveness.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in international markets relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in income investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Bob Elliott highlights important considerations around quantitative investing.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \"Behind the Ticker,\" Andrew Beer, an established figure in the hedge fund and ETF industries, shares his experiences and insights with host Brad. Beer discusses his journey through the hedge fund world, where he initially worked with prominent managers and later co-founded hedge funds, ultimately focusing on making hedge fund strategies more accessible and less costly through ETFs. This led to the development of hedge fund replication strategies, helping wealth managers transition from traditional 60-40 portfolios to more diversified approaches, especially amidst changing market conditions.Throughout the podcast, Beer delves into the challenges and strategies of asset allocation in the current financial landscape, characterized by higher interest rates and increased market volatility. He argues that while the traditional 60-40 portfolio excelled during periods of low interest rates, the changing economic environment necessitates a more dynamic approach to asset management. Beer emphasizes the importance of diversification and introduces the concept of \"crisis alpha,\" where managed future strategies provide significant value during market downturns by not correlating directly with traditional stocks and bonds.Beer further explains the technical aspects of his firm's managed futures ETF, DBMF, emphasizing its systematic, quantitative approach to replicating hedge fund strategies affordably. He outlines how the ETF is structured to maximize efficiency and transparency, making it an attractive option for investors seeking hedge fund-like returns without the associated costs. The conversation concludes with Beer advocating for managed futures as a necessary component of modern portfolios, providing crucial diversification that can enhance long-term investment outcomes.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Andrew Beer covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>Today we have on Andrew Brear from DBI, and we are talking about their managed futures\nETF, DBMF, which seeps to replicate the managed futures hedge fund performance, wrapped\ninside of an ETF, and without the fees and the carry. We talk about managed futures as a whole, how they could be viewed and should be used inside\nof a diversified model portfolio, and Andrew does a great job talking about investor and\nadvisor expectations for holding these types of funds.</p>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF.

We will learn the inner workings of their strategies and what drives them as they continue\nto grow their company. Many of these individuals are entrepreneurs, and will have unique and compelling insights\nto share as much goes on behind the Ticker.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So it is, it's 100% systematic. And, and what we do when we talk about the\ndiversification benefits of the space, it's, it's a little bit like saying, like, if you say the\nS&P 500, right, a consists of 500 stocks, you can look at each of the 500 stocks. But you're\nalways looking at the category. The category here is an index called the Soxgen CTA Hedge Fund index. And, and that goes back to 2000 with good data. And it's basically the average returns after\nall fees and expenses of the 20 largest guys each year.</p>\n<p>So, in statistical jargon, you would say it will raise the sharp ratio\nof a portfolio. Now, the, when you look at, so for instance, if you look at since 2000, and you\nsaid, what I rather have had a 40% allocation to bonds or managed futures, the kind of stunning\nconclusions you'd rather have an allocation of managed futures over that period of time, you would have\nbeen unhappy with it for 20 years and do literally happy with it for 40 years.</p>\n<p>But it's just, it's just one more leg of the asset allocation stool. And that's\nwhere I think they'll also sizing of the strategy ends up being important because you're going to have,\nyou know, I mean, as the world evolves, maybe you'll have some Bitcoin exposure. You'll have some\ndirect gold exposure, direct commodity exposure. You may have all these different different things that\nyou can add into that portfolio. And this should just be one of, one of those, one element with that.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"And that's why, that's why most of\nmy conversations are with people, where I like the conversations like to have with people who build\nmodel portfolios, you know, because because I want to be people's allocation today, but in 10 years.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"And that's why I think the,\nthe messaging, as you say on the front end, is literally just has to be explicit.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in fixed income relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in quantitative investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in income investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Andrew Beer highlights important considerations around fixed income.

    "content": "<p>In a recent episode of \"Behind the Ticker,\" host Brad delves into the innovative financial products from Calamos with guest Matt Kaufman. Kaufman, with a rich background in the ETF and insurance industries, discusses his journey through various financial sectors and how these experiences have shaped the development of new ETF products at Calamos. The episode focuses on the launch of Calamos's new ETF, CPSM, which offers 100% downside protection with capped upside potential, a novel approach in the ETF space aimed at providing investors with a safety net in volatile markets.Kaufman explains the technical aspects of CPSM, describing it as a structured product that combines options to deliver both capital protection and potential gains linked to the S&P 500 index. This ETF is particularly relevant in a rising rate environment where traditional low-risk investments like CDs and money markets become more attractive due to higher returns. Kaufman\u2019s detailed explanation sheds light on the potential of CPSM to be a game-changer for risk-averse investors looking for equity exposure without the downside risk.Throughout the podcast, Kaufman not only details the specific mechanics of CPSM but also discusses broader financial strategies and the future of ETFs. He envisions a significant shift of assets from traditional mutual funds to more tax-efficient and liquid ETFs, predicting growth in active ETFs. The conversation also touches on how these structured products can be incorporated into diversified investment portfolios to manage risk effectively. This episode provides deep insights into the intersection of ETF innovation and risk management, positioning Calamos at the forefront of this evolving market landscape.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Matt Kaufman covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>It was a fantastic opportunity looking back, learned to tremendous amount about the insurance\nworld, about hedging strategies, what works, what maybe doesn't work, and what we saw\nthere was largely rate-driven, a lot of insurance products are rate-driven, and so after\nthe financial crisis rates were extremely low, and it was very difficult to, from a investor's\nperspective, it was difficult to provide or get risk management or income from bonds. And so people were looking toward the equity markets to do that.</p>\n<p>Now that rates are higher,\nI think we have opportunities to generate risk management and income from bonds again. And so,\nto the extent there's rate declines, I think that those bonds make perform well. So, we have some\nother ETFs that are focused on that type of approach as well. Can Q is one of those ETFs that we\nlaunched a couple months ago. One thing that we've seen advisors use these protection products for\nis just derisking equity exposure.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>They were running equity risk management strategies, covered call strategies to generate\nincome. People were looking at the equity markets to generate risk management and income. And that worked very well. We had built around 50, 55 funds, largely for life insurance companies, variable-newty\nsub-accounts, raised a significant amount of assets there. The other thing that we noticed is it was difficult for life insurance companies to deliver\nmeaningful upside on their fixed index to newities, which for an ETF user may not be familiar\nwith that marketplace, but that delivers equity linked upside with no downside risk.</p>\n<p>And then you would pay ordinary income tax on that, which here in the highest tax bracket\nthat turns into 3.2, 3.3 percent. Or you can turn in that guaranteed 3.2, 3.3 percent\nand get the chance to earn your upside of the market. So you get the, you can link your cash\nessentially to the equity markets, get upwards of 9.8 percent, and then have no greater downside\nrisk over that one year out compared. So again, it's for folks who want to buy in at the beginning,\nhold till the end, they get that out-comperiod performance.</p>\n<p>But if you bought in\nthat day, you would have instead of a 9.8% upside. If the market was up 5, let's say your ETF's up\n2%, so you would have a 7% cap because you've got a 7% left. And then you would have 2% of\ndownside risk left. Or, I said another way, you'd have 98% protection. It's still very strong\nprotection because the ETF price is up 2%. So, that might be difficult to follow just on audio,\nbut hopefully everybody's tracking there.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"The trouble or the opportunity is\non the mutual fund side, that active bucket 13 trillion is almost exclusively in the mutual fund.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>This episode provides deep insights into the intersection of ETF innovation and risk management, positioning Calamos at the forefront of this evolving market landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in etf structure relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in risk management relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Matt Kaufman highlights important considerations around growth investing.

He explains how his firm has evolved from focusing solely on institutional clients to offering sophisticated active ETFs that make complex investment strategies accessible to a wider audience.Jason also discusses Rayliant\u2019s significant role in managing assets for government and sovereign wealth funds in Japan, Taiwan, and Canada. He highlights the development and strategic approach behind their Japan equity ETF, RAYJ, which aims to capture underexplored market segments through a blend of local expertise and quantitative methods.

It is particularly valuable for financial advisors and investors interested in understanding the application of quantitative research within the institutional investment landscape.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Jason Hsu covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>It's a concentrated portfolio of 30 growth names. They use a fundamental as well as quantitative approach to build the portfolio. I think it's a unique story. I think it's a great timing with international being so depressed in terms of valuation versus\nthe U.S. So we talk about the firm, we talk about the product,\nand we talk kind of briefly, they have a handful of other ETFs.</p>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF. Behind the Ticker, uncovers the inner workings of the ETF industry. We will interview portfolio managers and ETF service providers to dive deep into their\nwork lives and their businesses. We will learn the inner workings of their strategies and what drives them as they continue\nto grow their company. Many of these individuals are entrepreneurs, and will have unique and compelling insights\nto share as much goes on behind the Ticker.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>And so we are working with their portfolio managers to take what we think is\na more interesting segment of Japan that people don't talk about. It's really the small mid-cap segment. Now, occasionally we'll have larger cabinet, but primarily we'll focus in the small mid-cap\nsegment. They offer their deep fundamental research and we give to them the quantitative scoring\nof the stocks. And it's really the combination of two that then results in the final portfolio. So it's a very unique data, right?</p>\n<p>And that Japan might be, say, 20-8% maybe close to 30% of\ne-fuck, but I would definitely probably bring that up to closer to 50% and then downweight,\nEurope. Got it, makes sense to me. So as a new fund, or I should say, as a new issue,\nyou guys have out there. I always like to ask how you think about marketing the fund, right? It's one thing to come up with the idea, put it, do all of the work and produce good results\nfor your clients and those who use it.</p>\n<p>So let's talk about, you know, you have\nfour ETFs that I've seen come to market. We want to talk about RageA, which is RA, RA YJ,\nwhich is your Japan equity ETF. So if you could, can you please just explain the strategy\nat a very high level and what it's trying to accomplish?</p>\n<p>So first of all, please do find me on LinkedIn. That is the primary\nsocial media platform that I use in my firm use. So go on LinkedIn, find me and then add me\nas your connection and then add my newsletter, the bridge. And the idea is to bridge these\nless familiar markets with the US advisors. So you have a steady source of and both\nop-bed and research pieces coming from my firm. And then go to, you know, funds.railyand.com\nto get the perspectives for our different ETFs.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"But the growth callous seems so obvious\nwith the really ultra cheap yen with final inflation coming back to that economy so they can\nnormalize your interest rate and households as a result of that are receiving a strong income\nto their, you know, bank deposit and to their, you know, network.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>He highlights the development and strategic approach behind their Japan equity ETF, RAYJ, which aims to capture underexplored market segments through a blend of local expertise and quantitative methods.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in international markets relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in income investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Jason Hsu highlights important considerations around quantitative investing.

    "content": "<p>The podcast episode of \"Behind the Ticker\" featuring Greg Reid, the president of Real Assets at Westwood, offers a detailed insight into his background, the firm\u2019s operations, and the innovative strategies they employ. Greg Reid has a lengthy career in investment, dating back to 1987, and currently manages a team in Houston overseeing $2.3 billion in assets. Westwood, a public company based in Dallas, focuses on real asset management, particularly in the energy sector, with a strong emphasis on value equities and income-generating real assets.In the episode, Reid discusses the launch of Westwood\u2019s new ETF, the Westwood Enhanced Midstream Income ETF (MDST), which is particularly innovative due to its use of covered calls to enhance yield. This strategy aims to offer investors double-digit dividend yields by combining high-yielding stocks with covered call writing, which provides additional income and reduces portfolio risk.Reid also elaborates on the construction of MDST\u2019s portfolio, which selects stocks based on dividend yield and growth potential, aiming to optimize returns and manage risk. The fund\u2019s strategy involves a rigorous selection process, leveraging in-house research to identify the best-performing stocks within the energy sector, focusing on midstream companies.Marketing strategies for the ETF target high-net-worth individuals and RIAs, positioning it as an attractive option for those seeking income solutions within their investment portfolios. Reid\u2019s approach underlines the importance of combining sophisticated financial instruments with strategic marketing to appeal to a broad audience, highlighting the balance between innovative financial products and practical investment solutions for retirement and income-focused portfolios.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Greg Reid covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>And I'll mention our\nexisting mutual fund because it's a starting place. You know, it's, it's now 12 years old. We've\nbeen doing this a long time. SMLPX is our existing mutual fund. It's $968 million of assets today. And they're where we use the same benchmark AMEI, the Alarian midstream energy select index. So SMLPX is a total return focus fund, meaning we're looking at the yield plus the dividend\ngrowth and appreciation are objective. And today yields about 5.3%.</p>\n<p>In the ETF, we're targeting an\nincome approach first and foremost and then tell return second. So what we do is we basically\nown similar stocks in the two strategies. However, we naturally have a bias to pick higher yielding\nstocks in the ETF. So we're overweight, some of the 7 and 8% yielders. There are a couple\nstocks in the midstream market like Scheneer, LNG, that only yields 1%. Well, that's not a great\nfit, you know, for an income product or a target two and a half percent.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So the\ngross yield is 6.3. We actually can get a little bit more yield than when you're getting an SMLPX,\njust by tweaking our stocks selection or an active image ETF. We have a 6% team been doing this 17 years. Then what we do is say, okay, we have what we think\nis the optimal portfolio for return. Let's layer on top one month or two month covered calls. And so what we do there is we look at this strut and we look at the listed option market,\nyou know, no private options, no no flex options, just listed options that are liquid\nprice every day.</p>\n<p>You could take some out of that and plug this into a 10 or 11 yield\nand feel like you're adding value to the client's portfolio because you're picking up that guaranteed\nincome while lowering the beta. And so I think it could be in the alternative bucket. These are all public stocks. So it's probably more likely to be in the equity bucket,\nbut an income value add. And there's so many, you know, so I mean, the market, it's had a good rally.</p>\n<p>So they bought us as a addition to their platform. And energy fits in great into the value DNA of the firm. You know, energy stocks are cheap, high dividend yield,\nour portfolio yields about 6%. And we have a adaptive asset allocation business called broad mark. That was part of salient. And then Westwood has a multi-asset class business that's run by\nmy partner, Adrian Helford, that does a variety of things\nin both fixed income and equities. And so that's, you know, I think a very helpful strategy.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"And that's why you find a lot of\nstocks are right around 4.9.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The podcast episode of \"Behind the Ticker\" featuring Greg Reid, the president of Real Assets at Westwood, offers a detailed insight into his background, the firm\u2019s operations, and the innovative strategies they employ.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in income investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in etf structure relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Greg Reid highlights important considerations around fixed income.

    "content": "<p>In this episode of \"Behind the Ticker,\" host Brad interviews Kim Mayer from GMO. Kim has been with GMO for over 18 years, starting his career on the sell side at Morgan Stanley before transitioning to the buy side. He currently holds a dual role at GMO as a portfolio strategist and covers several sectors including luxury goods, beer, spirits, and retail.Kim discusses the launch of GMO's QLTY ETF, which marks GMO's strategic entry into the ETF market. He explains how the ETF aims to make high-quality investment strategies accessible to a broader audience through a focus on U.S. equities. The approach combines both qualitative and quantitative methods to ensure a robust selection process that emphasizes quality and proper valuation.The episode also delves into Kim's personal interests, highlighting his love for activities on water, reflecting his move from New York to Boston. Overall, the podcast provides insights into GMO's investment philosophy and operational strategies, as well as offering a glimpse into the personal life of one of its key figures.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Kim Mayer covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>But he came up with some good identifiers and initially GMO used that in our equity practices\nby practicing a form of quality adjusted value. We launched this strategy 20 years ago\nand have kept that focus on valuation. I think that's an important differentiator because there's\nplenty of different ways to get quality into a portfolio today. But to get back to your original\nquestion, it's not a clone of the existing strategy. So the flagship quality strategy,\nwhich is still a mutual fund and separately managed accounts, is a global opportunity set.</p>\n<p>Today, I have on Kim Mayer, he is a portfolio strategist over at GMO, and we're here to talk\nabout their newly released Quality ETF, Ticker QLTY. It is a US-focused, active ETF that is looking for obviously quality, as well as attractive\nvaluations. They've been running a similar strategy for many years in a mutual fund wrapper, and this\nis their first ETF over at GMO. We talk about the difference between quality and other quality ETFs that are more indexed\nfocused.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>And we're\ngoing to look at a bunch of things, but we're going to focus mostly on valuation as we do that\nprocess. And so what we seek to deliver is a company is a portfolio that's comprised of the very\nhighest quality companies, but screening out those companies that are trading at unrealistic valuations. Because I think even with quality companies, people will tell you that quality wins over time,\nbut what our research shows you is you can do substantially better in terms of delivering\nreturns across periods and can actually pretty significantly increase that downside protection\nand return signature as well by combining quality and valuation.</p>\n<p>Just because\nI think people are concerned generally with the overall risks that equity investors face today,\nand quality has shown to be a good defensive way to get equity exposure over time. And finally,\nI think, you know, it is our focus on valuation that means that we're not dependent on a growth\nregime being in place to be able to deliver strong performance or a value regime being in place. The last couple of years have shown that very nicely, you know, 2022, very much a value\ndriven year, 2023, very much a growth driven year.</p>\n<p>Step three would be, or I guess, difference three would be around portfolio\nconstruction. So, Qual, SPHQ, they're not willing to look that different from the benchmark. And so,\nthey're going to be constructed in a venture, in a sector neutral standpoint. So, that means they're\nforced to own the highest quality real estate company, the highest quality materials company. We don't think that they're already. So, we don't own those. And so, you know, those\ncontend to be riskier areas of the market.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"We talk about the difference between quality and other quality ETFs that are more indexed\nfocused.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"Yeah, and so GMO, you know, we're not the biggest shop in the world.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>He currently holds a dual role at GMO as a portfolio strategist and covers several sectors including luxury goods, beer, spirits, and retail.Kim discusses the launch of GMO's QLTY ETF, which marks GMO's strategic entry into the ETF market.</li>\n<li>He explains how the ETF aims to make high-quality investment strategies accessible to a broader audience through a focus on U.S.</li>\n<li>Overall, the podcast provides insights into GMO's investment philosophy and operational strategies, as well as offering a glimpse into the personal life of one of its key figures.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Kim Mayer highlights important considerations around quantitative investing.

    "content": "<p>In the latest episode of Behind the Ticker, Brad Roth engages with Simeon Hyman from ProShares, delving into the intricate world of ETFs and the innovative strategies behind them. Hyman, with over three decades of experience in asset and wealth management, discusses his role at ProShares, a firm that manages around $65 billion across various ETF solutions. The conversation highlights Hyman's personal interests, such as music and outdoor activities, providing a glimpse into the individual behind the professional expertise.A significant focus of the episode is on ISPY, ProShares' unique covered call ETF that leverages daily options, a novel approach aiming to optimize investor returns while generating income. Unlike traditional monthly covered call strategies that might cap gains early in the month, ISPY's daily options strategy seeks to capture the full potential of the S&P 500's performance. Hyman elaborates on the competitive yield and monthly distribution of ISPY, positioning it as an attractive option for investors looking to incorporate income generation into their equity portfolios. He also addresses the risk profile associated with ISPY, aligning primarily with the S&P 500, and outlines how the ETF can fit into investors' core equity holdings.The conversation also touches on the broader ETF market, with Hyman speculating on the future of covered call ETFs and ProShares' commitment to innovation. For listeners interested in the intersection of investment strategy and innovation within the ETF space, this episode provides valuable insights into one of the leading firms in the industry and their approach to creating investment solutions that meet the evolving needs of investors.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Simeon Hyman covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>We manage, as I said, about $65 billion of funds in the ETF structure,\nand we have a range of solutions. Some may be familiar with our leverage and inverse funds that are very valuable for folks who are\nlooking to either hedge their portfolio as they get particular exposures. And then we also have a very important, more classic buy and hold business. Among the flagships, there are a suite of dividend growth ETFs, including\nticker and OBL, the S&P 500 dividend aristocrats that some of your listeners may have heard of.</p>\n<p>And we think those classic dividend growers are certainly a place where people are returning\ntheir attention to. I mean, it was kind of a weird year over the last two years. Equal weight has been left behind. A lot of different places in the market. Like value have also been left behind. So I agree with you. I think that that could be a place where investors start to be looking\nand it putting some some of their asset allocation dollars.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>Before we get started, can you tell me a bit about your background and how you ended up\nyear at ProShares? Sure, I've been in the asset and wealth management business for about 30 years, and I've been\nat ProShares over a decade, ProShares is a leading ETF provider. We've got about $65 billion in funds across a range of solutions, and I just love the opportunity\nto be part of 21st century solutions at an innovative firm. So what about outside of work?</p>\n<p>You don't have unlimited exposure. So that's where they're called a covered call. And that's been a popular income generating strategy for folks because you get money for selling\nthis call option. But many folks, I think have forgotten about the other piece. You're selling away the upside. And so it's it is a yield play. What type of yield can\ninvest investor expect to generate with a product like yours? So let me first start with the\ntraditional strategy. A traditional monthly covered cover call strategy writes a call once a month.</p>\n<p>So by writing these on a daily basis, the S&P 500. And this is an index strategy. I know wake up in the morning and decide how to do this. This is the S&P 500 daily covered call\nindex that we track in ice buy. But it indeed has risk similar to the S&P 500. And look,\nthe 10 year treasury is now at 4%. If stocks go down, they're likely going to go down because\nthere's a recession. In which case, we are likely to finally have bonds do their diversifying job.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"We've got about $65 billion in funds across a range of solutions, and I just love the opportunity\nto be part of 21st century solutions at an innovative firm.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"And the challenge there is let's say you sell away the right for the upside of your stock.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Unlike traditional monthly covered call strategies that might cap gains early in the month, ISPY's daily options strategy seeks to capture the full potential of the S&P 500's performance.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in fixed income relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in options strategies relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Simeon Hyman highlights important considerations around income investing.

    "content": "<p>In this episode of \"Behind the Ticker,\" Brad Roth engages with Dodd Kittsley from Davis Funds to explore their ETFs and mutual funds. Kittsley brings a wealth of experience from his early involvement in the ETF industry in the late 1990s to his present position at Davis Funds, offering insights into the development of ETFs as tools for broadening market access.Davis Funds, founded in 1969, has evolved from focusing on institutional clients to offering mutual funds, SMAs, and ETFs, partnering with financial advisors to address investment strategies and investor behavior. The conversation highlights two particular ETFs: the Davis Select U.S. Equity ETF (DUSA) and the Davis Select Worldwide ETF (DWLD). DUSA aims for selective investment in undervalued, durable companies with effective management and potential for sustainable growth, adopting a Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) approach. DWLD, on the other hand, offers a global investment perspective, aiming to invest in the best businesses worldwide without geographic constraints.Kittsley emphasizes the role of deep research and a focus on long-term wealth over short-term earnings, advocating for a conviction-driven, actively managed approach. Beyond the professional insights, Kittsley shares personal interests in family activities, gardening, and sports, reflecting on the balance between personal life and professional commitments.This episode provides a comprehensive overview of Davis Funds' investment strategies, emphasizing the importance of informed, active management. For more information about Davis Funds and their approach to investment, their websites offer detailed resources for investors looking to understand the choices available in different investment vehicles.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Dodd Kittsley covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>It's such a great question because for some, looking at the portfolio, sector\nwaiting's holding, it could be a bit of a headscratcher. But as you point out, it is 100% conviction\nweighted 100% conviction driven in terms of the, the holdings we have. We often will say we're\nbenchmark agnostic and it's not to mean we don't care about our bogear, the benchmark or the\nopportunity set we're looking at, but we will never true up say a sector that we don't own.</p>\n<p>He is with Davis Funds. They are a long-standing staple in a household name and investment management. They've done a fantastic job and a variety of different strategies. They have an extensive mutual fund and ETF lineup. However, today, we are going to focus on DUSA, the Select U.S. Equity ETF, as well as DWLD,\nthe Davis Select Worldwide ETF. First of all, Dodd has an absolute wonderful guy. I enjoyed the little bit of time that I did spend with him.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So it's, it's really the epitome of what we do,\nright? It's, it's, it's, it's creating a best ideas portfolio that is incredibly selective. We believe\nthat what you don't own is as important as what you do own particularly in this environment where\nmoney isn't free anymore interest rates are more normal in selectivity really matters. So Dusa\nhas 22 to 23 holdings right now. And what we look for in that portfolio is stocks that are\nundervalued mispriced in the marketplace that are durable have very well capable management teams\nthat can allocate capital well right cultures companies with competitive modes.</p>\n<p>So that's, I think\nreally where the case for active is, right? We have a process where certainly we'll screen for\ncompanies that are viable, but without knowledge of their management team, their competitors,\ntheir customers, their sustainable advantages, we wouldn't invest in this. So how are the portfolio\nwaiting decisions made? Is that, you know, conviction by your management team or is there\nsome other thing behind it to keep it more market cap-weighted? How are those waiting decisions\ncome about?</p>\n<p>It's like, well, we don't do that. We're not a mutual fund provider. But he thought about that. And that was that was the genesis of Davis advisors. Fast forward to the\n2000s we got in the SMA business to provide choice. But on the same investment discipline, the same\nstrategies, the same type of exposures that we did in mutual funds. And then in 2017, we got in the\nETF business. And that was driven by the same questions from our clients.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"I've been incredibly fortunate in my career to have stumbled on ETFs back in the late 90s,\na time where there were 32 products less than $40 billion in assets and people didn't know\nthe difference between an ETF and an EFT and an Exchange Funds.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"And I don't think the really the market recognized that this could be something that was\nfor everybody, for the retail investor, the individual investor.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in etf industry relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in etf industry relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in etf industry relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Dodd Kittsley highlights important considerations around etf industry.

Sal's journey began at UBS, transitioning from various roles to Zacks, where he embraced the ETF space. Zacks, starting in 1978, specializes in earnings estimate revisions and surprises, crafting strategies around quality and consistency.ZECP, designed as a core portfolio piece, invests in large cap, quality companies demonstrating consistent earnings and resilience through market cycles. It typically includes 50-65 names, chosen through a rigorous screening process emphasizing historic and forecasted EPS stability.SMIZ targets opportunities in the small and mid-cap space, focusing on earnings estimate revisions and market anomalies, holding around 198 names. Unlike ZECP, it does not prioritize earnings consistency but rather seeks to exploit less covered market segments for alpha.Zacks also offers \"Zacks Plus,\" a unique product combining ETFs and SMAs into holistic solutions, tailored across risk spectrums without strategist fees. It allows advisors to deliver more sophisticated, efficient portfolio options, focusing primarily on domestic equities.Sal suggests ZECP can complement large cap equity exposures like SPY, offering downside protection through its focus on quality. SMIZ serves as a dynamic small to mid-cap exposure, aimed at capturing alpha in less scrutinized market segments.

So we're not giving you exposure to 700\nnames, the portfolios, the model portfolios range from about 47 holdings to 120. No, so last question here, if you're not using XX plus, right, and I'm an RIA, I've already\nhave my model portfolio set and you're just selling the opportunity to add ZCP or Smiths into\na portfolio, where are you putting these in an overall model portfolio construction? I just assume\nZCP is probably in a line with large cap equity exposure.</p>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF.

We will learn the inner workings of their strategies and what drives them as they continue\nto grow their company. Many of these individuals are entrepreneurs, and will have unique and compelling insights\nto share as much goes on behind the Ticker.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So from looking at both of the ETFs in your lineup,\nthere seems to be this theme of resilience and times of volatility. So why is managing risk and\nvolatility so important? Meaning like what can minimizing volatility or standard deviation mean\nto an investor over the long term?</p>\n<p>So there's not really\nany holdings in the portfolio that are above two to 2.1 percent, right? So it's fairly,\nevenly distributed. So let's talk, I want to talk about Zax Plus. Can you just say what it is? And then really how it works.</p>\n<p>And you don't have to go down the road of pulling in three or four different managers doing\nthree or four different things, right? We, we are primarily a domestic equity shop. I mean, most of the,\nmost of the tilts are run that have single stock exposures are domestic equity, right? Our international sleeve is a, is a model comprised of third party country specific ETFs. So we know our bread and butter is domestic equities. And that's how we're running our SMA\nsleeves as well.</p>\n<p>We continue our live from the Exchange ETF Conference series today with Sal, Esposito. He is from Zax, and we are going to talk about two of their ETFs today. ZECP, which is an earnings consistent portfolio, and Smith's a small midcap core ETF\nticker SMIZ.

    "content": "<p>The podcast episode of \"Behind the Ticker,\" hosted by Brad Roth, features Johan Grahn from Allianz discussing the intriguing world of buffered ETF products. Johan Grahn, with his extensive background in investment and asset management over two decades, delves into how buffered ETFs provide investors with defined outcomes, integrating protection against market downturns with a cap on maximum gains. These innovative products, primarily based on the S&P 500, aim to manage investment risk while ensuring transparency and building investor confidence.Grahn's journey through university endowments, consulting, and roles in large insurance companies has honed his expertise in risk-managed strategies and portfolio construction. This experience underpins his current role at Allianz, where he oversees the launch of buffered ETFs, a testament to his commitment to developing products that balance risk and return efficiently.The conversation explores the mechanics of buffered ETFs, including their reliance on an options package to achieve predefined outcomes. With different levels of protection (buffers) and durations available, these ETFs cater to a broad spectrum of investor needs. Grahn explains the reset process at the end of each outcome period, which allows for continuous protection and potential growth.Buffered ETFs emerge as a flexible investment solution amidst a noticeable shift towards more conservative strategies among retiring individuals. The podcast highlights how these ETFs can serve a wide range of investors, from those seeking to reduce equity risk in their portfolios to those looking to add risk in a controlled manner.Listeners interested in Allianz's buffered ETFs can find more information on their website, which offers comprehensive resources, including videos and product tables.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Johan Grahn covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>Those have learned a lot about how to, like, squeeze the most amount of return\nthat you can out of the least amount of risk that you take, right? And I'm only mentioning all of this because it's going to lead into where we're at today\nin the position that I have working with ETFs for Aliens investment management. We launched a series of buffered ETFs or defined alchemy ETFs. And it's a very clean way to get exposure to a risk managed product in a very transparent way\nthat can help you build confidence into what you do on the investment side.</p>\n<p>That's your risk, no matter what the other half of the\nportfolio is. So right now, if you think equities and fixed income, okay, fixed income, it may\nor may not give you that buffer that you're looking for from it. But you don't need it unless\nthe equity markets are going down. There's no real, strong reason to own a sliver of income stream\nif you can't rely on the diversification benefits from that, sleep to fixed income. So if you're\nlooking for diversification, you have an opportunity to build in a buffer ETF.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So when you don't need that free lunch\ncorrelation that everybody's been reading about and the MPT stats and the Monte Carlo simulations\nand every textbook about finance and investing, you don't really need the correlation benefits\nunless the markets are working against you. Mostly they don't work against you. Mostly they work\nfor you. In a buffer ETF, you have positive correlation when that is the case. And then as markets\nstart coming down, equity markets start coming down, you are decreasing the correlation in the buffer\nallocation closer and closer to zero.</p>\n<p>So can you tell us a little bit about your background and how you ended up in the position you\nare today? Sure, yeah, it's a longer backdrop perhaps, but I've been in the investment asset\nmanagement side of the business for a good 20 years. So a lot of what I've been doing has to do with portfolio and management and asset allocation\nand mixing and matching and building different types of risk profiles. And I've been doing that in different capacities, started out after college working for a\nuniversity endowment fund.</p>\n<p>But let's say that you can\nif the market goes up another ten percent. Let's say you get to keep that too. You know, the following\nyear. But the neat thing, too, is that the buffer underneath of your investment is also going up. That's the account value is going up. So if I'm an RIA and I've got a regular client list and\nI'm building model portfolios. How are you using these ETFs?</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"The beauty for the investor,\none of the really cool things is that we buy it on day one, but you ask an investor, you can buy it\non day two, three, 16 or 48, whatever day whatever day that looks attractive to you because it's\ndaily trading.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"And you also kind of went into like the difference between a buffer and a floor.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in fixed income relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in portfolio construction relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in alternatives relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Johan Grahn highlights important considerations around fixed income. Understanding the strategy behind each fund\u2014not just the ticker\u2014helps advisors make more informed allocation decisions and better communicate the rationale to clients.</p>\n<p>The themes of fixed income and portfolio construction discussed in this episode are particularly relevant in the current market environment, where advisors are increasingly looking for differentiated solutions that go beyond traditional benchmarks.</p>\n<h2>Listen to the Full Episode</h2>\n<p>This article is based on an episode of <em>Behind the Ticker</em>, hosted by Brad Roth, Founder and CIO of THOR Financial Technologies.

    "content": "<p>In the episode of \"Behind the Ticker,\" Brad Roth and Weldon Rice from Qraft Technologies discuss the integration of artificial intelligence within the investment landscape, particularly through Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). This conversation provides a detailed look at how Qraft applies AI to develop and manage ETFs, offering insights into the practical implications and methodologies behind AI-driven investment strategies.Weldon Rice introduces two specific ETFs during the discussion: the QRFT and the AMOM. The QRFT ETF is designed to leverage AI in managing a portfolio of U.S. large-cap stocks, aiming for a balance between diversification and performance by analyzing large datasets to identify market trends and inefficiencies. The ETF maintains a portfolio of roughly 300 to 320 stocks and is adjusted monthly based on AI's analysis.The AMOM ETF, in contrast, focuses on capturing momentum within the U.S. large-cap space, holding a more concentrated portfolio of around 50 stocks. This ETF seeks to dynamically adjust to market conditions, emphasizing stocks or sectors displaying strong momentum. It's described as having a more focused investment strategy, with potential for higher volatility given its concentration and rebalancing approach.Rice emphasizes the role of AI as a tool to complement, rather than replace, human decision-making in the investment process. The discussion highlights how AI can enhance traditional investment strategies by providing deeper insights into market data and trends, thus aiding in portfolio construction and risk management.By examining QRFT and AMOM, the episode explains how AI technologies are applied in the creation and management of ETFs. These examples illustrate Qraft's approach to integrating AI into finance, aiming to offer innovative solutions for investors looking to benefit from the advancements in AI for portfolio management and investment decision-making.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Weldon Rice covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF. Behind the ticker uncovers the inner workings of the ETF industry. We will interview portfolio managers and ETF service providers to dive deep into their\nwork lives and their businesses. We will learn the inner workings of their strategies and what drives them as they continue\nto grow their company. Many of these individuals are entrepreneurs, and will have unique and compelling insights\nto share as much goes on behind the ticker.</p>\n<p>So, I know you guys have a lot of other products and I'm going to have\nyou or somebody else from your team back on, because I know you're going to keep launching ETFs,\nbut let's talk broadly as we kind of close out. How should advisors, if you're a registered\ninvestment advisor, how should they be thinking about implementing AI driven strategies inside\ntheir portfolio? Like, do you see them as a holistic solution or more of like a satellite exposure?</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>And what we're trying to do is use AI to bring a more robust exposure to those factors. We're trying to look at more like risk adjusted returns, especially when we're looking at\nsecurity selection in that space. In terms of what we do with the large language models,\nwe don't employ as much on the on sort of textual and sentiment data. But we do have some\ncapabilities there, and especially, you know, recently we just launched a new ETF with LGI research.</p>\n<p>There's an ETF market in Asia. There are many ETFs in Korea. In fact,\nMere Asset, one of the largest SM managers in Korea, actually owns Skullblex ETFs. Several other\nETFs around the globe. So they have their own locally ETFs that they have. So Asia has a pretty\ndecent ETF market.</p>\n<p>I worked a little bit in higher education and I moved the broad whenever I write out a college. So I've been in Asia, living in Asia for a bit over 12 years. And then I ended up studying in finance while I was there in Korea. I studied under some quant hedge fund managers and some really big players in Korea,\nlike Goldman Sachs had there and really really fell in love with finance,\nespecially quantitative approaches to finance. So yeah, I got an opportunity to come on board with craft technologies.</p>\n<p>So as you mentioned,\nETFs is just one part of what we do. And we were actually founded in 2016. And we're\nfounded as an investment technology company. So outside of just the ETFs, we also do\nmodel portfolios. We've run different sort of vehicles. So we're really a B2B solution\nproviders. We work with, we're based out of Seoul, Korea. And we work with a lot of largest financial\ninstitutions in Korea starting out. A lot of that was model portfolios or portfolio construction\nhelping them to launch AI power products their own products.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"And I think for most\npeople, you might get confused on what the difference are between those.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The QRFT ETF is designed to leverage AI in managing a portfolio of U.S.</li>\n<li>The ETF maintains a portfolio of roughly 300 to 320 stocks and is adjusted monthly based on AI's analysis.The AMOM ETF, in contrast, focuses on capturing momentum within the U.S.</li>\n<li>This ETF seeks to dynamically adjust to market conditions, emphasizing stocks or sectors displaying strong momentum.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Weldon Rice highlights important considerations around quantitative investing.

It's about delivering exposure of crypto to our investors and really being that\ncrypto specialist for the market.</p>\n<p>Look,\nwe had tremendous, tremendous conviction that we were going to deliver on the promise that we\noffered our investors that we were going to deliver Bitcoin in an ETF rapper. And in 2013,\nwhen this product was built, and it predates me, but it was built to mimic GLD's construct, a 33\nact, Delor Grantor Trust, that was going to be a building block for clients in their portfolios.

And then it permeated the rest of my life, the smartphone and the internet. The issue here is we have another disruptive technology upon us. The first use case is kind of\nuseless to many people in the US market. And I remind them it's a disruptive technology. And this is\ngoing to have the properties of growth tech.

So law firms like us are a first full service firm, so we are\nalways not only in the asset management practice, but other areas like tax, or risks,\nthin-tapped other areas that might touch on what an ETF manager might need some input on. So we would help you not only with the formation, the registration, even if you're managing\na fully transparent, passively managed ETF, and you don't have to get an incentive relief anymore\nfrom the SEC, you still need to get an effective registration statement.</p>\n<p>So before we get into like the growth\nof the ETF in the US and that whole industry is exploded, if I am an asset manager today,\nand I'm thinking about launching an ETF, and I'm picking up with the phone and I'm calling you\nabout how long do you think it would take me to get something to market? I'm sorry,\nI'm just thinking about initiating an ETF, and I'm calling you, okay, and I'll get you some\nstarting, just thinking about the process.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So if you start ETF that's not guaranteed that because it's grown so much, you're automatically\ngoing to get tons of assets from day one. But the benefits that ETFs have has since day one,\nwhich is tax efficiency, relatively lower cost for investors, that's continued to grow since\nday one. I think there's been demands for AIAs to offer more ETF products to the clients. We're also seeing growth in the form of conversions where mutual funds are converting, hedge funds\nmight be converting, separately manage accounts.</p>\n<p>Well, second of last question for you. What does growing a fund\nand compliance look like in Europe versus the US? And what you need to obviously think of the\nand the use it's overlay. And so you're going to be subject to the use it's regulations. And\nthe use it's are highly regulated investment products. And you have portfolio and the thing\nbut your portfolio transparency requirements. We've got the benchmark regulations. So benchmark\nadministrators are subject to make sure that their indexes are compliant with them certain rules.</p>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF.

So we created the fund. I lived down here in Charleston. So we say y'all in the New York Times, anointed y'all the\nmost inclusive of all pronouns. So I wanted to be inclusive because we're all about diversity,\nequity and inclusion around here. So we gave it the ticker y'all and why the heck not call it the\nGod bless America ETF.</p>\n<p>Today we have on Adam Carran, he is the founder of the God Bless America ETF, Ticker y'all,\nY-A-L-L is a fund that focuses on US equities, however, has a filter and screen to eliminate\nthose that are involved in political agendas and activism. He believes that businesses should be focused on doing business, rather than getting involved\nin public conversation around politics, and so he wants to only invest in those companies\nthat he believes aligns with his core values of businesses staying involved in only business\nand focusing on the task at hand, which is delivering shareholder value.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>There was some like biblical responsible funds,\nbut the conservative funds were like just a bunch of crusty industrials and oil and gas companies. And I was like, well, all the growth from the markets have been coming out of the tech sector. We can't just put everyone's money and oil and gas and tell them to hang in there. They'll go\nup sooner or later. And then even some of the biblically responsible funds and funds that were a\nlittle bit more, I don't know, call them anti-woke.</p>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF. Behind the Ticker, uncovers the inner workings of the ETF industry. We will interview portfolio managers and ETF service providers to dive deep into their\nwork lives and their businesses. We will learn the inner workings of their strategies and what drives them as they continue\nto grow their company. Many of these individuals are entrepreneurs, and will have unique and compelling insights\nto share as much goes on behind the Ticker.</p>\n<p>I never had a cup of coffee\nand put all my money in shockful of nuts and would open up the newspaper every week and see\nthat stock drop lower and lower and lower. And watched half of my wealth disappear, investing in\na crappy coffee stock. So, I made a commitment at that point. I said, I'm never, ever, ever\nmaking an investment without doing a little research on my own and just started tracking the\ncapital markets. And I was hooked like so many of us in this industry.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"The biggest challenge I have quite\nfrankly is finding quality tech names.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"The whole point of that company is to gather\ndata, of course, make vehicles that drive with electric.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>He introduces the God Bless America ETF, which aims to provide conservative investors with an investment option that aligns with their values.</li>\n<li>He emphasizes the importance of focusing on business and returns for shareholders.</li>\n<li>Curran emphasizes the need for financial education and building a community of investors.</li>\n<li>Investing in the American Dream is a key aspect of Retire Y'all's philosophy.</li>\n<li>Retire Y'all aims to continue growing and providing valuable resources for investors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Adam Curran highlights important considerations around active management.

I started my career as a financial advisor at Morgan Stanley. Then went to go do research at Value Line initially, and then went to what is now S&P Global. S&P I was on the non-index non-credit rating side of the business, covering individual stocks. And an opportunity came about to move into ETF and mutual fund research and build a research platform. Which I did over 10 years ago, and while it was there, the business I was a part of got sold\nto an independent research company called CFRA.</p>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF. Behind the Ticker, uncovers the inner workings of the ETF industry. We will interview portfolio managers and ETF service providers to dive deep into their\nwork lives and their businesses. We will learn the inner workings of their strategies and what drives them as they continue\nto grow their company. Many of these individuals are entrepreneurs, and will have unique and compelling insights\nto share as much goes on behind the Ticker.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>It's great for the industry. It's a sign that the ETFs remain a go-to vehicle to get exposure and we're seeing great trading\nand great flows, but there are 3,000 other products that people should be paying attention to. In some cases are paying attention to, and it's in the best interest of my readers and my content\nthat I write about something else besides a Bitcoin ETF, because at the most, it's going to make\nup reasonably a couple of basis points.</p>\n<p>I'm sorry, a couple of percentage points of their portfolio\nand there's other products to consider. Yeah, no, it was, I was following everything on Twitter\nand it just seemed like it was a roller coaster ride. So if I were in your shoes, I'd probably\nbe relieved that it's over and stop having to write about it all day every day or tweet about it all\nday every day, so. But anyways, let's pivot over to verify. Can you talk about\nVettify's business specifically around how they can help and how they assist ETF issuers\nand the types of products and services they have?</p>\n<p>It feels good to be back, and we start off season two with a big one. He is from Vettify, and we are talking all things. The exchange ETF conference down in Miami. There are a handful of wonderful sessions, great speakers. We talk about the ETF community as a whole. Todd is very dialed in on all things ETF. So I hope that you all find this episode insightful, and if you are listening to this,\nprior to the exchange ETF conference, I look forward to seeing a lot of you down there.</p>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Todd shares his insights on the future of the ETF industry and offers advice for new ETF issuers.</li>\n<li>The conversation highlights the collaborative nature of the ETF community and emphasizes the importance of ongoing engagement and communication.</li>\n<li>\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The future of the ETF industry is expected to see continued growth in actively managed ETFs, conversions of separately managed accounts (SMAs) into ETFs, and a focus on education and collaboration within the community.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Todd Rosenbluth highlights important considerations around active management.

    "content": "<p>The guest on this episode of the \"Behind the Ticker\" podcast was Matt Barry, head of product management and ETF capital markets at Touchstone Investments. Touchstone is a $25 billion mutual fund manager that has historically focused on active management strategies. As Matt explained, Touchstone aims to beat benchmarks by looking meaningfully different than the benchmarks, using high conviction best ideas from 15 different subadvisors across various strategies.</p>\n<h2>About Matt Barry and Touchstone Funds</h2>\n<p>Seeing the continued growth in active ETFs, Touchstone has been building out an ETF platform over the last few years. They launched their first four active ETFs around a year and a half ago. Matt discussed how investor demand is driving the growth due to the structural benefits ETFs offer like tax efficiency, liquidity, and transparency while also providing exposure to active management strategies. Regulatory changes have also made it easier for active managers to launch ETFs.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>Matt highlighted a few of Touchstone's newer active ETF strategies including HEAT, their climate transition fund, which is managed by Swiss firm Lombard Odier and invests in companies benefiting from the transition to a cleaner economy. Their ultra short income (TUC) and securitized income (TSEC) ETFs focus on securitized fixed income assets and are managed by the experienced structured credit team at Fort Washington. TSEC aims for a higher yield with the ability to allocate to some non-investment grade securitized debt.</p>\n<p>In terms of distribution, Matt explained how Touchstone is leveraging their existing mutual fund distribution network and relationships with advisors. However, they have also worked on developing internal ETF expertise to ensure their wholesalers are fluent in discussing the ETF structure and considerations when speaking with advisors.</p>\n<h2>Portfolio Construction and Implementation</h2>\n<p>To learn more about Touchstone Investments please visit touchstoneinvestments.com</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Matt Barry covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>Historically,\nthe strategy is offered a similar yields to high yield corporate bonds but a much lower volatility\nprofile. It's in the short-term bond category. So you're not taking a lot of interest rate risk there. For it's a pretty pretty compelling risk return profile on the pair with something like\nyour high yield corporate bond portfolio. Yeah, no, that makes a ton of sense to me. Before I let you go, you had mentioned earlier that you've got a distribution team of about\n50 and you guys have been around for a long time, a very robust mutual fund business.</p>\n<p>So we have several hundred\nmeetings a year with asset managers across asset classes. Sometimes at times in the past, we've had\na particular search. Some of the mutual funds side a few years ago, an example of that, we looked\nin the liquid-alt space, ended up hiring a rescapable that to run our credit opportunity strategy\nconsists of high yield bank loan CLOs in the below-investment grade space. Sometimes we had a very specific search and we're really happy with that measure and how they've\nperformed there.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>When we think secure ties investments, residential, mortgage-backed securities, commercial\nmortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations,\nas kind of a key building blocks of that strategy. Historically secure ties investments have been a\nreally interesting place to be from a risk return for a file perspective, rather something\nlike the investment grade corporates or high-yield corporates. The team at Fort Washington has run\nultra short-term, mutual fund for, well over a decade now. The team's been together for over\n20 years, actually, it's a very stable team with a lot of experience, running short duration\ninvestments, specifically in secure ties.</p>\n<p>So the niche that we're trying to fill there\nis more of a specialist manager, more cognizant of the capacity of our strategies who are to\nmanage that, are some advisors continued off of the ability to add really strong alpha through\nrisk to adjust your returns, also protect on the downside. And what that looks like varies a little\nbit depending on strategy, where some managers might be higher on the upside, others might focus\nmore on the downside. It really varies in terms of managers across the breadth of our roster.</p>\n<p>Before we get started, could you tell us a little bit about your background and how you got\ninto the position that you are today? Yeah, so I'm Matt Barry. I run product management and ETF capital markets for Touchstone Investments. I've been with Touchstone, and also our parent company before that, for combined about 10\nyears now, joined after business school, and then Touchstone is about a $25 billion mutual fund\nmanager. So historically, that's been our business as part of my time running product here.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"The reality is that\nthe world is getting warmer behind on some of the goals on climate change.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>As Matt explained, Touchstone aims to beat benchmarks by looking meaningfully different than the benchmarks, using high conviction best ideas from 15 different subadvisors across various strategies.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in active management relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in income investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Matt Barry highlights important considerations around fixed income.

It's definitely\nmore expensive, but for somebody with so much experience in the ETF business, why did you think\nthat that was just a better route? So there is a lengthy, federal rolling in Southern District of\nNew York related to my experience as a white label client. Unfortunately, the judge ruled that\nessentially our products were stolen from us. The risks of that, the learning experiences from\nworking, not saying that every platform is going necessarily do that, but having had the experience\nhappen to me was something that I couldn't look back and put myself in the same position and being\nable to build our own infrastructure.</p>\n<p>We had\nall the skills that we had all the knowledge needed to be able to do it on our own and it really\nmade sense, especially given the first experience I had.

(TICKER: TOLL).</p>\n<h2>About Yuri Khodjamirian and Tema ETFs</h2>\n<p>Yuri shares his background in finance and how he eventually became CIO at Temma. He talks about his interests outside of work, like exercising and reading widely across different topics.</p>\n<h2>Investment Strategy and Approach</h2>\n<p>They discuss the key sources of competitive advantage for monopolies, including non-replicable physical assets, network effects, high switching costs, regulation, and economies of scale. Yuri explains why good monopolies arise by providing mission critical products and immense customer value over time.</p>\n<p>Yuri outlines Temma's investment process for selecting securities in the Toll portfolio. It starts with creating a pure thematic universe of monopolies, then applying fundamental equity analysis to identify the best companies. He mentions targeting 30-35 holdings in the portfolio.</p>\n<h2>Portfolio Construction and Implementation</h2>\n<p>They dive into Temma's rigorous risk management, using multiple layers like security selection, portfolio construction tiers, and continuous monitoring. Yuri explains their active but systematic rebalancing approach. On portfolio construction, Yuri details their conviction tier system for position sizing between high, medium and low conviction names. He explains how this takes advantage of managers' stock picking skills while controlling for risks.</p>\n<p>Yuri discusses how Toll can fit into an investor's portfolio, arguing it essentially high grades on quality and durability versus a typical core allocation. He suggests investors look beyond just tech and growth stocks. For more information about TEMA ETF visit: temaetfs.com</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Yuri Khodjamirian covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>So one of the first things I did when I joined\nbefore we launched the funds or hired any portfolio managers sit down and think about the investment\nprocess. And one of the key things that we wanted to focus on, especially with this idea of risk\nmanagement is his position sizing. And if you look at the literature and I spent a lot of time reading\nand talk to a lot of market participants, you realize a couple of conclusions.</p>\n<p>We think, what is the valuation case here? And in my world of monopolies often, some of these\ncompanies are a little bit richer value than the market. And you need to really build a really\ngood solid valuation case. And then finally, what is our edge in this particular stock and investment? And that's a really difficult question of fund managers often don't ask themselves, right? And so we force everyone in the terms of the time of process to ask that.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>And this is what we found. We've been testing in the market\nin lots of the models and it works really well. Fund managers is like the structure around it because\nit gives you this kind of risk management approach. And the reason for this is,\nfrom the mentally active management is really good in general. The good fund managers are good at\npicking stocks. They're not that good at sizing the positions. So you need some rules and guidelines\non sizing to make sure you harness that stock picking alpha in the funds.</p>\n<p>Today we have Yuri Kojermirion. He is the portfolio manager for the Tema Monopolys and oligopies ETF, Ticker TOL. A fascinating product, extremely well thought out. I loved my conversation with Yuri talks about how they go about picking the certain companies\nthat sit inside their ETF. We talk about portfolio management techniques. We talk about risk management.

And we can talk about risk management, which is a key tenant of of of tema. But we look, we we try to aim anywhere around 30, 35 holding. So I think where you can express\nclear conviction of the portfolio. I don't think we'll ever go about 50 or 60, but they're\nmight be cases where it happens. We won't all go below 25 holding.

    "content": "<p>Ragen Stienke, founder of Ballast Asset Management, joined the Behind the Ticker podcast to discuss his 30+ years of experience in small and mid-cap investing. Ragen got his start in the 1990s at Arthur Anderson's business valuation group before working at UBS and later founding a SMID strategy at Westwood. In 2015, he started Ballast focused on small and mid-caps, offering both SMAs and their Small/Mid Cap ETF called MGMT. Ragen aims to turn alpha generation into a process focused on quantifying downside risk rather than relying on conviction. He sees opportunity in the small and mid-cap space as coverage by analysts has declined, believing this segment will outperform large caps in the coming years.\u00a0Ragen evaluates management teams for alignment, capital deployment history, and strategic fit. Ragen positions MGMT as a replacement for passive ETFs or to balance large cap growth tilts in models, focusing distribution on RIAs and advisors rather than consultants. He summarizes Ballast's approach as \u201clooking both ways when crossing a one-way street.\u201dTo learn more about Ballast and Ragen please visit ballastam.com</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Ragen Stienke covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>So it's really two things. Either A is a replacement to Pantos ETFs and a lot of\nmany of the ETFs out there within that our competitors trust or either something\nor quantitative or just peer-prepared. And we are part of the fundamental one. And I think it's something like this where there's a lot of uncertainty that that's where\nreal value comes in play. And the other is just purely in allocations. We've seen over the last 10 years the large cap growth is basically dramatically\nperformed a small cap to you.</p>\n<p>We have a proprietary\nrisk management model that that we employ to help help them understand and putting those different\npositions together. And we say an analyst job is paint perfect stroke on a piece of\ncanvas. It's our job to make sure that we have a picture that\nmakes sense. So part of this model is fundamentally driven. We look at all the revenue and earnings\nassociated with all of our businesses and break those down based on one of those things like\ncyclicality and markets, etc.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>Today we have Reagan Steinke. He is the founder of Ballast asset management. They have a long history in the space, specifically small and midcap SMA products,\nand have jumped into the ETF world a few years back with their small midcap\nactive ETF, MGMT. I think you are going to find this conversation extremely interesting,\nspecifically around their fundamental process, as well as how they\nview and evaluate management and how they view and evaluate risk.</p>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF. Behind the Ticker, uncovers the inner workings of the ETF industry. We will interview portfolio managers and ETF service providers to dive deep into their\nwork lives and their businesses. We will learn the inner workings of their strategies and what drives them as they continue\nto grow their company. Many of these individuals are entrepreneurs, and will have unique and compelling insights\nto share as much goes on behind the Ticker.</p>\n<p>Historically, we have a managed primarily institutional capital. I've got a point in the beginning. Probably 85% percent was institutional. And then three years ago, through a, or I should say, as a result of an\nSEC opinion letter. I've got a lot of different interests such as ourselves. They have the same efficiency and an ETS strategy. It's the, we launched the first my knowledge.</p>\n<p>I hope running SMAs and continue to run SMAs to the head. The way I think about the ETF is the same strategy. It's just a different vehicle or act to think of the same strategy. We have a single strategy.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"It's an evaluation group that I'd like to say that's where\nto gotten things in the real world, as opposed to an academic perspective.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"The commissions are the up any or half a penny of share and a lot of these days and the reality is that many of the large brokerage firms.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ragen aims to turn alpha generation into a process focused on quantifying downside risk rather than relying on conviction.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in quantitative investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in quantitative investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Ragen Stienke highlights important considerations around quantitative investing.

So we're really excited about, as a product. And then two other larger equity\nportfolios win, which is large kept growth ETF that we've launched with Johnson Associates\nand G-Div, which is a both dividend portfolio that we launched with our partners at Westfield. That was actually a mutual fund that we converted so it's a long track record there.</p>\n<p>Today we have Steve Cook. He is the head of ETFs at Harbor Capital. We talk about the business. They got their start by sourcing investment managers. Then dove into the fund management business, managing mutual funds, CITs, and a handful\nof ETFs. Steve has a ton of experience.

And so, Banking York was selected as a trustee, and I got to first hand look across the board. The investment management piece for an index perspective of the capital markets and trading\npiece, because there was no centralized data repository. And so, the folks trading these things on the floor would call you for information and updates\non how what changes the ETF made made, and the basket knows what to think.</p>\n<p>So it's a nice concentrated. These are large global businesses that when you look at it,\nreally want to own. You want to have exposure to. As folks are seeking out returns and uncoorrelated\nterms, looking at international products that are, that are owned businesses that you want,\nnot just for diversification, but because they're really well run. And and C-Worldwide looks at it\nas international compounders. So folks and, and management teams that kind of compound the success\nof their business over time by reinvesting the capital or the stewards of capital.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"Um, and so one of the, the real major benefit to going to the floor is you're taking\nthe computer out of it and you're inserting a live individual back into it.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"And now all of a sudden, you know, the pipeline, the opportunity\npipeline kind of explodes because, you know, you've been telling the stories for 18 months, people see\nit working, but they're waiting for that period of time where they're able to actually go in and\nnow you're starting to see that.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In this episode, Steve provides background on his experience in the ETF industry and Harbor Capital's evolution into the ETF space.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in fixed income relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in portfolio construction relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Steve Cook highlights important considerations around income investing.

She elaborates on the importance of a disciplined, long-term approach, emphasizing how TACK's method of relying on monthly data helps mitigate risks and navigate the complexities of the financial markets.The discussion also sheds light on Fairlead Strategies' commitment to providing robust, research-driven insights and how the firm supports investors through thought leadership, regular market analysis, and educational content. Stockton's expertise illuminates the pathway for both individual and institutional investors seeking a deeper understanding of technical analysis and its practical implications in portfolio management.For more information about CNBC contributor Katie Stockton and her firm Fairlead Strategies visit www.fairleadstrategies.com</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Katie Stockton covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>That is then supplemented by opportunistic\npositions in strong environments. So let's say, we have this relief rally underway in the equity\nmarket. And in our research, we're telling people to take advantage of it by increasing exposure\nto higher beta assets. And so tack remains a holding, but then you could supplement it perhaps\nwith high growth, innovative technology stocks, something of that nature. And that would boost\nperformance in a strong tape. And also, you know, create opportunity to, I know a lot of people\nreally like individual stock investing, we do too.</p>\n<p>Today we have Katie Stockton. She is the founder of Fairlead Strategies. She is also the portfolio manager behind TACK, the adaptive sector rotation ETF. I was very excited to talk to Katie. Her and I have a lot of the same beliefs and ideas around investing. She is also a veteran when it comes to technical analysis. And she is also a CNBC contributor. I think you will find the strategy behind the rules-based strategy behind TACK,\nquite compelling, and so I hope you enjoy this conversation with Katie Stockton.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>We call it fairly tactics. You're\nprobably gathering these more voting references in here. And fairly tactics are foundational\nreport. It has our views on the S&P 500 on the sector relative strength. It has\nviews of crude oil, gold, the dollar, treasury yields, really anything that influences equities. And that's where we help people find opportunities, manage risk. We highlight some\nthemes and ideas in that report as well. We recently launched something called the ETF Navigator. Knowing that a lot of advisors are using ETFs as a primary investment vehicle.</p>\n<p>And that's been something that I've learned as I've gone along. We, as technical analysts, we're not advisors, well, we are technically investment advisors,\nbut not the kind that you're talking about. So we ourselves don't have client accounts with\nmodel portfolio. So we've learned as we've gone along in terms of how advisors are using it. My intention truly was to create something that was holistic, right? So let's say a retail investor\ncould just buy tech. And that could be their equity market exposure.</p>\n<p>So that's something I would encourage people to check out. We are a little less active, perhaps on Twitter than some, or X now, but we do have a profile\nthere in Twitter at Stockton Katie, so people can follow us there as well. And for the ETF,\nthere's the fund website, which is fairly funds.com, and folks can track the holdings and learn\nmore about the strategy that way. Well, Katie, again, it was a pleasure to meet you. Really happy we got the opportunity to do this.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"And in that major, we had the opportunity to have an internship,\nand it was the internship that set me on the path initially,\nto study in technical analysis as a discipline.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"So again, before we jump\ninto it, I did see the video of you getting the opportunity to ring the bell at the New York Stock\nExchange.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in quantitative investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in risk management relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in income investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Katie Stockton highlights important considerations around quantitative investing.

With over two decades of experience in the ETF arena, Will has carved a unique path by focusing on providing investors with high-conviction stock positions through innovative and disruptive ETF investments.GraniteShares, Will's brainchild, boasts a diverse ETF suite covering everything from commodities to income, equities, and leveraged single stocks. In this episode, we have the privilege of delving into the world of these disruptive single stock ETFs, including red-hot names like Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, and Apple.Will expertly articulates the case for single stock ETFs,\u00a0 and conviction investing. He explores the remarkable demand surge witnessed in recent months, particularly with earnings season on the horizon, and offers insightful glimpses into what the future may hold for these investment vehicles.Our guest, Will Rhind, isn't just a seasoned professional; he's the Founder & CEO of GraniteShares, managing over $1.7 billion in total assets under management. His impressive journey includes a stint as a Principal at iShares and as a key member of the original European ETF team. Notably, he also spearheaded ETF Securities in the U.S. and helmed the world's largest commodities fund, the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD). Find more information at graniteshares.com</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Will Rhind covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>So in the, in the simplest form, it's an ETF,\njust like any other and all leverage ETFs work the same. So they're typically providing exposure\nvia swaps, which is a derivative contract that you procure from an investment bank and investment\nfor those providing with the leverage and via this stock contract to the funds. So\ncollateral, you have margin and you have a derivative contract that gives you that exposure. And all these funds rebalance at the end of each day.</p>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF. Behind the Ticker, uncovers the inner workings of the ETF industry. We will interview portfolio managers and ETF service providers to dive deep into their\nwork lives and their businesses. We will learn the inner workings of their strategies and what drives them as they continue\nto grow their company. Many of these individuals are entrepreneurs, and will have unique and compelling insights\nto share as much goes on behind the Ticker.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>Today we have Will Rind, he's the founder and CEO of Granite Shares. He is a very long and tenured career in the ETF business spanning over 20 years. He's worked on products like GLD, and went out and launched his own firm Granite Shares in 2017. They have grown quite significantly, and today we're going to talk about their single stock\nlevered ETF products with names like Tesla, Coinbase, and the video distribution and asset\ngrowth on these products has been very hot, so I think this conversation is very timely\nand also very interesting to get Will's perspective on the ETF space as a whole.</p>\n<p>In other words, the client never buys from us directly. What we see is\nthe net effect of all of the buys, all of the sales in the market on a given day and the residual\ncomes to us in the formula in order to create more shares or in order to cancel or redeem\nshares. So it's difficult, but I think it has to be a combination of the both. I mean,\nI looked yesterday, an NVDL was the best performing TF of the year so far, so it's done incredibly\nwell.</p>\n<p>So, anyway, think of Europe, we think of bonds,\nentity, but, is obviously when it comes to, to the, I mean, I saw a flow chart of far market\nversus the European market, and it is about as complex as it can get over there, comparison. I mean, don't get me wrong, people love UTS, it's just, there are just, there are just some\nfundamental challenges, which mean that the U.S. has accelerated, you know, far faster than anything\nin Europe, and, and, you know, some people say that Europe's like five years behind whether you\nexist, and it's probably one way or another.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"That's why we target the stated leverage\nfactor we call it, but that's why you'll see there's a amount of times in the case of\na lot of funds is different.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>His impressive journey includes a stint as a Principal at iShares and as a key member of the original European ETF team.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in income investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in crypto & digital assets relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Will Rhind highlights important considerations around crypto & digital assets.

So that that comfort level needs to be established quickly and it needs to lead to action quickly. Second of all, everyone has some level of pre-logged marketing which is obviously within compliance\nof their new ETF strategy and advisors will either be committed or will wait and see.</p>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF. Behind the Ticker, uncovers the inner workings of the ETF industry. We will interview portfolio managers and ETF service providers to dive deep into their\nwork lives and their businesses. We will learn the inner workings of their strategies and what drives them as they continue\nto grow their company. Many of these individuals are entrepreneurs, and will have unique and compelling insights\nto share as much goes on behind the Ticker.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>There are some funds that are self-seated in the sense that they're a mutual\nfun conversion, with assets or an SMA and a contract transfer with assets. But that aside, for those\nnew ETFs that need to launch in a rather conversion, we provide the seed, and then we agreed to\nbelieve market maker on the respective exchange that they choose. And that means that we're acquired\nto post reasonable bid offer quotes during all market hours every day of the week.</p>\n<p>I mean,\nhaving all those boxes checked on day one is extremely important. I like the term that you use\ntheir bread. It is institutionalizing, you know, the business because I think that's what it becomes. In terms of whether it's a firm that's known for one or two neat funds, but they're successful\nand they raise assets or are growing line up of, you know, broadly diversified funds to extend\na long short commodity, long short equity may be some dividend value growth type equity ETFs.</p>\n<p>I think why because the retail base of advisors and institutions that\nuse these have confidence now the products are traded and structured and they they they suit and\nneed they suit and need within portfolios. So I think you'll continue to see options based or options\noverlay ETFs. Whether they're defined outcome buffers or something like AAPI, JP from JP Morgan,\nthere's no shortage of funds in that space now too. All within the last two or three years. So it's gone from like a fund category of relative obscurity to something that has billions\nand assets and growing as well as new filing.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"So I saw the merits of being a startup, the challenges of being a startup and the ETF\nspace on the issuer side.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"Thanks very much for the opportunity Brad I always\nenjoy speaking with you and look forward to the next time.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in income investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in income investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in income investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Paul Weisbruch highlights important considerations around income investing.

This episode provides insights into the services and technologies offered by UX Wealth Partners to Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs).We explore how UX Wealth Partners employs its technology to offer solutions that go beyond traditional asset management platforms, providing tools and resources aimed at improving operational efficiency, client engagement, and business growth for financial advisors.Join us as we discuss the current landscape of investment technologies, share insights on model portfolio best practices, and consider the circumstances under which a model provider might launch an ETF. For more information about UX Wealth Partners and their offerings, visit uxwp.com.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Kyle Wiggs covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF. Behind the Ticker, uncovers the inner workings of the ETF industry. We will interview portfolio managers and ETF service providers to dive deep into their\nwork lives and their businesses. We will learn the inner workings of their strategies and what drives them as they continue\nto grow their company. Many of these individuals are entrepreneurs, and will have unique and compelling insights\nto share as much goes on behind the Ticker.</p>\n<p>And so what we look for are strategies who have a very\ndisciplined technology, almost rules base, that has proven whether it was 2008, whether it was\nfourth quarter of 2018, whether it was during COVID, they have a disciplined, on emotional way\nof derisking the portfolio and limiting drawdowns. You're not going to miss all of it and certainly\nyou give up some of the upside. But it's the idea over a full cycle if you can keep a client\nfully invested through the ups and downs.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So you get an overnight sink and you\nhave to, you need to send that data somewhere that is very good and accurate at processing the data. Then they need a piece of technology that can automate and handle trading. Some advisors may not\ntrade that often, and it may not be as important. But as we see a wider adoption of technology\ndriven investments, how you trade is almost as important as the investment itself. So I think that\nthe trading component of the overmanagement piece is going to be really important.</p>\n<p>And then let them use it for two to three years. Let's\ngo raise a few hundred million bucks on your strategy. Then let's go to the very people that are\nusing it and saying, hey, you've got a $25 million allocation to the SMA and half of that's\nin non-qualified business. If we launch an ETF, would you be interested in converting that? And so now you could see where you could get an ETF to a hundred million dollars over nine\nversus a lot of them launch because the firm thinks they have a good idea, but they don't show up\non any screens.</p>\n<p>Today we have Kyle Wigs. He is the founder of UX. Well, there are technology companies that help investment\nadvisory firms put together an efficient tech stack. They also do trading, billing. They also have a very unique set of model portfolio strategies that are made available to their\ninvestment advisors. A lot of those strategies utilize technology or artificial intelligence in some way shape or form. So, Kyle has a very unique perspective from the investment advisory space as to what the\nbest practices are and how advisors are utilizing technology to make their business more efficient\nalso provide better outcomes for their clients.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"And so\nwe went out and we started asking a lot of questions of these various platforms, large institutions\nand really what we found was, it wasn't that they didn't believe that the technology could do a\nbetter job.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"Humans fundamentally, by the time you\nresearch analysis and we meet with the investment committee and vote, it's already priced into\nthe market.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in quantitative investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in growth investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in portfolio construction relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Kyle Wiggs highlights important considerations around quantitative investing.

    "content": "<p>In Episode 18, we're joined by John Davi and Frank Tedesco from Astoria Advisors, who have just introduced their second ETF, ROE - US Quality Kings. We delve deep into the current state of the U.S. stock market and explore the intricacies of the ROE strategy.Astoria's US Quality Kings ETF is an actively managed Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) designed to pursue long-term capital growth. It achieves this by investing in a well-diversified portfolio of 100 high-quality U.S. large-cap and mid-cap stocks. What's unique is that each of these stocks is equally weighted, mitigating the potential challenges associated with market cap-weighted indices.Furthermore, the fund optimizes its allocation within sectors, meticulously selecting the highest quality stocks in each sector, mirroring their weight in the S&P 500.To gain further insights into Astoria Advisors and their innovative ROE approach, be sure to check out their website at astoriaadvisors.com.</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and John Davi & Frank Tedesco covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>So, like you said, when you started a story, or since you started a story or rather,\nquality has been the ballast of our core U.S. equity position, and yet concentration risk is\na hot topic this year, but the reason that it's impacted are portfolio positioning,\nit's because so many ETFs are market-tapped-weighted, quality ETFs are market-tapped-weighted,\nso you may not even realize, but your quality exposure may also be 20%, the stocks that are\nleading the S&P 500 itself right now, because they are a quality company.</p>\n<p>So that's the one premise that this ETF is grounded on. In quality is shown through the research of the factors who have a higher\ncircle ratio, which means that per unit of risk you're taking, you're getting a better return\ncomparatively to the other factors. It may not achieve the same level of compound annual growth rate,\nand it's not the most volatile, but you get better predictability and higher quality companies\noutperform the market and lower quality companies outperform the market.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>But before we transition\nover there, I think one of the things I find interesting, I'm not sure how many retail investors\nyou really get to talk to. I get to talk to a good bit of them, and they just seem tired. And they seem\nlike, now where rates are where they're at, they're very happy to be packing money into money market\nfunds and to treasuries and getting their five to five and a half percent yield. And just saying,\nhey, look, I'm good with this.</p>\n<p>You can look at the\nformer French data, but those are the two premise premises that this fund is based on. So now the\nconstruction, it's 100 of the highest quality US stock, and we sector optimized to the broader\nlarge cap universe. So what that means is if the market has 28% tech for example, we'll also have 28%\ntech in our ETF, but instead of three stocks making up 16 or 17% of that 20, we'll have 28 different\ntech stocks each making up 1% of the total ETF.</p>\n<p>So we want liquid stocks, we want stocks above 5 billion, so we'll have some midcaps in\nthere too, and from those initial screens, we get down to around 800 stocks. And then from there,\nwe use the quality metrics that best define each sector based on historical research. So the\nmainly it's ROI, ROI, and return on invested capital, but different combinations of those\nthrough different periods such as one year or five year, best define each sector. So we still\nthrough the best quality stock for each sector, and that's how we make those selections\ninto this sector optimization.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"If you didn't have the opportunity to listen to the last episode about their inflation ETF,\nwe talked a lot about the firm and some of the different offerings they have.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"And so, that's why I think you have this, like,\nvirtuous circular, you know, kind of feedback loop.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>stock market and explore the intricacies of the ROE strategy.Astoria's US Quality Kings ETF is an actively managed Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) designed to pursue long-term capital growth.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in portfolio construction relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in fixed income relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with John Davi & Frank Tedesco highlights important considerations around quantitative investing.

She is the founder of Vegtech Invest and the portfolio manager of EV, which invests in food\ninnovation companies. She is an expert in all things food and nutrition. And we talk about some of the things that are issues with our food, how we produce food,\nmake food, ship food, and I think you're going to find it extremely interesting. So I hope you enjoy this episode with Elizabeth Alfonno. Elizabeth, welcome to the show.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>I mean, it's one of\nthose mass trends when you shift food, not necessarily what people eat, people are still going to\neat meat, but it's how that meat comes to them. It's going to be in a much more efficient way. When I looked at that, I thought, okay, I want to do the investing in these companies around the\nworld without our working on this disruption. And when I couldn't find that in the public markets,\nI thought, okay, this product needs to exist.</p>\n<p>So before we get started, please explain for everybody who is listening kind of your background\nand how eventually you decided to start the Vegtech plant-based innovation ETF. So I've been after graduate school and BA. I've been working in food systems with the Kellogg company, special K Frosted Minuits,\nthese were my brands and I worked on them not from just the brand management perspective,\nbut from really running independent businesses. Production, packaging, logistics, shipping, sales, marketing, etc. And I loved working in food and I loved working at the Kellogg company, actually,\ninternational company focused on healthy products, give or take, we'll say.</p>\n<p>You have the younger consumer, Millennials and Gen Z,\nMillennials, by the way, not that young anymore. But okay, we'll call them younger and Gen Z,\nand I guess even Gen Alpha. Very much behind putting their dollars where their values are and not\nbeing detrimental to the planet. So they're really driving the growth of plant-based innovation. What you have government spending in IP, at the same time that you have large food manufacturers\ncoming under scrutiny from the SEC and others for the impact that they have on the planet.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"That's why major cause of heart disease, diabetes, um, colorectal cancer.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"That's why you now have seeds that can produce monochrops of soil that\nis not fed to people.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in growth investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in energy relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in active management relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Elysabeth Alfano highlights important considerations around growth investing.

For more information on DIP visit dipetf.com</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Ryan Pannell covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>Today we have Ryan Pennell, he is the founder of Kaiju Advisors. He runs a handful of private funds and also his ETF dip, DIP. The Ticker explains at a very high level to strategy, but there is much, much more\nbehind the hood as Ryan is a true AI specialist. This is a 100% totally AI-wrong strategy. We get into AI and what it means and how it operates to make investments decisions specifically\nin his strategies. I could have talked to Ryan for probably three or four hours.</p>\n<p>We go through this linear process, quantitatively, okay, the criteria that I had, flagged,\nwere met. Now, I'm going to evaluate further, is your fundamentalist, your reading reports,\ndoing fundamental forward-looking analysis, et cetera, to come to the yes-no-by-sell-hold decision\nthat we make. So, AI doesn't do that. And black boxes, the most outside. So, you can't explain any of\nthat. With us, we have an investment ideology that we teach the machine. And it doesn't, on the\nprivate one side, ETF side doesn't matter.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>That door opens\nit to in 20. And the funds that run it effectively are usually like 3.5 and a sliding scale up to 40,\nright? Because they're generating these 40, 50, 60 percent returns. You look at Renaissance\ntechnologies. I mean, Medallion has been closed forever, but if Medallion was open to the public,\nit's 5 and 45. That's where you get that type of technology. So this is a way to get it\nliquid with very low risk for a percent and a quarter, right?</p>\n<p>So it's nice to have an ETF that's publicly accessible, performance is publicly viewable. I think we're somewhere around 12% plus 12% in the last 90 days, so that's been good for us. And we're just looking forward to trying to make these type of AI curated and directed\ntraining systems more accessible. Because today, I mean, what you've really seen these in\nhigh-end hedge funds, which your average investor is never going to get access to. So this is a\nway to sort of bring it to a broader investment base and hopefully do some good with it.</p>\n<p>And then so you have your beta correlation,\nlike, right there. And then you're going to layer your alpha opportunities on top of that. But at the\nend of the day, responsible allocation, conservative investment will contain some sort of the\ndata tracking allocation like that. And what we're saying is, okay, so we don't want you to replace\nthat with us until maybe you get to a point where there's enough of a history there that you're\nconfident doing so at this stage, but consider us instead of some portion of that.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"In terms of like, are we going to see it get to the point where\nit just fundamentally changes the training strategy?\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"So why don't\nyou take, you know, the opportunity to really just talk about the the high level investment strategy\nand what is trying to accomplish and what is trying to invest, really trying to get exposure and\nsure.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>With a background in theoretical physics, quantum mechanics, cosmology, film, and television, Ryan has a unique perspective on investment management and the applications of artificial intelligence in scientific trading.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in portfolio construction relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in crypto & digital assets relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Ryan Pannell highlights important considerations around crypto & digital assets.

Alejandro is the portfolio manager behind the Aztlan Global Developed Markets SMID Cap Strategy ticker AZTD. AZTD is Atzlan\u2019s stock selection ETF, a unique rules-based strategy that selects the top 27 stocks based on fundamental factors. AZTD uses a proprietary 6-factor fundamental model to assign stock rankings: cash flow generation, value, growth, capital structure quality, earnings revisions and momentum. The Fund\u2019s stock picks represent companies in developed markets across North America, Western Europe and Developed Asia, with market caps between $500 million and $10 billion. Energy, Real Estate and Pharmaceuticals are excluded. To learn more about Alejandro and AZTD visit www.aztlanetfs.com</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Alejandro Garza covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>And at the same time, if you are listed in\nMexico, you have a very significant tax advantages. Basically, a 10% tax, compared to a 30 plus\npercent tax on on on on on on returns. So, we said, okay, we have this quantitative plus\nfundamental process, we're, we're specialized, or we, we, we, we like to say and think that we\nspecialize in stock picking and we like to think that we're, we're good at it and we've had very\ngood performance.</p>\n<p>Number one, combining quantitative analysis with fundamental analysis. I think the combination of those two ways of approaching markets and investments\nis really helpful, and really provides for a competitive advantage\nwhen you combine those two aspects in an efficient way, quantitative analysis, and fundamental analysis. The other aspect that I thought that we could really make a difference was in terms of stock\nselection. Stock selection meaning you have to build a concentrated strategy if you really want\nto beat the market.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>We also\ndefine nine sectors out of the 11 sectors of the general classification that we're used to. We exclude two sectors and one industry. The two sectors that are excluded, energy,\nand because it's a commodity, highly volatile, and in some parts of the\nmacroeconomic curve, we also exclude real estate. A lot of our investors already have a lot of\ndirect real estate exposure in their portfolios. So we don't want to have a double exposure there,\nso it's fluid real estate.</p>\n<p>So it's unexplored that gives this segment a valuation advantage\nbecause it's underrepresented under bought 10, they tend to trade at a discount to the broader market. But then at the same time, they're large enough that they're not as volatile as a smaller\ncompanies that are below the 500 million mark. So we think it's really the sweet spot of the market\nwhere we have opportunities to find really interesting companies, really differentiated companies that\nhave all the potential to grow into big caps, large caps, mega caps, and, and it's a very fertile\nground for us to do our research process.</p>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF.

David\u2019s background in the music industry is extensive, having previously served as President of Music Publishing at LiveOne, a global media company for livestream and on-demand audio, video and podcast content. He is also the former President of Music at AGC Studios and IM Global Studios and was the co-founder and CEO of Evergreen Copyrights, where he pursued a global acquisition strategy of music publishing catalogs and built one of the largest independent music companies worldwide, which eventually was sold to BMG Rights Management.Needless to say this is a fun interview. MUSQ aims to invest in the most attractive segments of the global music industry. The music ecosystem is comprised of all things music like streaming, content and distribution, live music events and ticketing, satellite and broadcast radio, and equipment and technology. The segment is growing and evolving quickly and David gives us his views as to where the music industry is headed.

We will learn the inner workings of their strategies and what drives them as they continue\nto grow their company. Many of these individuals are entrepreneurs, and will have unique and compelling insights\nto share as much goes on behind the Ticker.</p>\n<p>And what I realized was over my career bread that it was really hard as an investor to get exposure\nto music. You had to be an LP, a lot of these private equity firms that I mentioned. And you had to show net worth of whatever it was, a million or five million dollars. And so over the last 10 years, you've also seen an explosion of music companies become available. You have everything from streaming to content, a live music to ticketing, to satellite and to radio.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So you have companies like IHeart, which are so all around the country. You have companies like Serious Radio. You have companies in Australia like Arne and Southern Cross. You have Town Square Media. So those are the five categories. We have 48 companies on the index. And we give investors broad exposure to the entire ecosystem. MUSQ is the first pure play music ETF designed to give investors global exposure\nto the music industry ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Today we have David Shohoff. He is the CEO and founder of MUSQ, which is the first pure play music ETF. He is a very compelling background, very interesting and fun and unique background. And we talked a little bit about that, we talked a little bit about the innovations\nthat are happening in the growth in the music space. I think you're going to find this conversation very entertaining, also very educational. I think David's done a wonderful job constructing his index, and please enjoy this episode\nwith David Shohoff.</p>\n<p>So, first of all, it is outpacing the growth of the S&P. The index is up 22% for the year. And the MUSQ index is up 22% for the year. And it is outperforming the S&P. So it's definitely a product for RIAs. I see this and honestly, I see this in every portfolio allocation. I don't know how you don't have one or two or three percent whatever the number is. You're getting, you know, very strong returns. And, you know, it's technology.</p>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>MUSQ aims to invest in the most attractive segments of the global music industry.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in small & mid cap relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in growth investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with David Schulhof highlights important considerations around growth investing.

    "content": "<p>Episode 13 features Adam Eaglston, the Chief Investment Officer of Formidable Asset Management. Formidable is an active and adaptable financial services company. They employ a disciplined process and build client portfolios and develop financial plans. The Firm also manages a hedge fund the 'Formidable Fund' which is a multi-strategy fund. In this episode we discuss their Formidable ETF, ticker FORH. The fund is an active multi-strategy equity portfolio that also deploys a hedging component to help protect during market declines. The fund is rooted in the OODA Loop Framework: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act which allows them to identify attractive investment themes and exploit market inefficiencies via top-down framework. For more information on Adam and the firm please visit formidableam.com</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Adam Eagleston covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>We've seen people bucket it in two ways. One would be, as it was designed, which is the\none-stop alt-sleeve for portfolio, and depending on the overall asset allocation, that could be between\n5% and 20%. The other way that we've seen some people use it is because it's categorized as\nmid-blend, and because you do have relatively the reasonable portion of the portfolio that is small\nand mid-cap, we have seen some people use it for more small, mid-cap exposure, but you would have,\nyou would certainly have some basis risk there because it's just not going to track that in\nnext particularly.</p>\n<p>To be perfectly blunt, it doesn't track any index particularly well,\nwhich is a blessing in a curse. So certainly a blessing in 2022, when you had during a down market,\nI think incredibly good performance versus a pretty large drawdown, and then obviously,\nless good this year, but I think that speaks to essentially our ability to deliver\nuncorrelated returns here, despite the fact that the portfolio tends to be majority equities. Right, and I always find that question funny when I'm talking to an advisor about a model\nthat we're running or our ETF, and they're saying, well, the tracking air is really high.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>Like it's just if you're only spending five hours a week doing that, you're just\nnot going to be able to do it as well as you probably want or that your clients probably want. And I think there's actually a pretty big disconnect too between the relative value that clients\nplace on investment performance and unique portfolios and how much value the advisors place\non those based on the studies I've seen. So I think that disconnect is really an opportunity for\nyou and for us to find some of these advisors who might be willing to take a step back and\nto be perfectly fair.</p>\n<p>Today we have Adam Egelston, the Chief Investment Officer at Thor Medible. They run the Thor Medible Fund, which is Ticker F-O-R-H. They also have Kong, K-O-N-G, but today we primarily talk about F-O-R-H. They run an RIA, they also run a private fund, and they also have another ETF coming\nhere in the future. So you're going to learn a lot about the firm, you're going to learn a lot about for\nage, in particular, and how that could fit well inside your portfolio, I think specifically\nsomething that's a little bit uncorrelated and more as an alternative to fit a holistic\nmodel portfolio.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"So again, if you think back to that hub and spoke model, what we found\nis that as we were putting models together for the advisors to use, that the more traditional\npieces of it, you could find solutions there for the most part.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"But what we found is that when\nyou got to the alternative sleeve, that often you had very small pieces of the eradicating,\nand it just became administratively a little bit of a headache if you had a 1.5% weight in\nREITs and 2% in listed private equity and 2% merge arms.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The fund is rooted in the OODA Loop Framework: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act which allows them to identify attractive investment themes and exploit market inefficiencies via top-down framework.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in portfolio construction relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in etf structure relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Adam Eagleston highlights important considerations around income investing.

Rareview Capital works with advisors to help develop systematic and differentiated strategies using their goals based approach. Neil heads the firm\u2019s investment team and oversees all portfolio and risk management activities. Neil also serves as a Portfolio Manager for the Rareview ETFs. We focused on the Rareview Systematic Equity (RSEE) and Rareview Dynamic Fixed Income (RDFI). Their unique systematic approach to investing provides investors an alternative lens on how to navigate investment markets. To learn more about the firm and the Rareview ETFs, visit rareviewcapital.com</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Neil Azous covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>And so part of our deliverables,\nwhich we may complimentary to our investors or shareholders or prospects, is that we provide\nthem our research. And our research focuses on three things. Idea generation, risk mitigation,\nand portfolio construction most importantly. And so we're trying to fill that void between\neconomic strategy and trading of putting it all together in a process driven framework. And then\nbeing very transparent about that and filling in all the blanks regarding the questions around\nportfolio construction, what the market is doing, etc.</p>\n<p>And finally, we produce our own research. Regarding my background, I'm the founder, the managing member and the chief investment officer\nof Rare View Capital. I had our investment team and oversee all portfolio risk management activities. And I also serve as the portfolio manager to the four Rare View ETFs that we manage. I've been fortunate enough to have worked with some great firms like Goldman Sachs,\nStiles and Lovekan and Genre and UBS investment bank. And I've been trained in various capacities by some of the best minds of the industries\nthat have pioneered various products that we use every day in the capital markets.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So, the investment objective is to seek a return that exceeds global\ndeveloped and emerging market equity. And so, the funds benchmark would be an all-country\nworld index. And the performance or the strategies performance is derived from four regional\nsubstratages that we believe target important sources of global equity market return. So,\nthere are four indices, one that tracks US large gap. So, the S&P 500, one that tracks US small\ngap, the Russell 2000, a third one for non-developed, I'm sorry, not US developed markets such\nas EFA and then the final one being MSCI emerging markets.</p>\n<p>Rare View Capital is an independent SEC Register Investment Advisor and ETF sponsor. Above all else here, we champion goals-based investment management. We believe aligning investment solutions with investment goals is really the best approach\nto reaching once aspirations. The idea of investing by a style box or exposure to a region or an asset class\nin our experience does not deliver the real world outcomes that investors seek. And that's our overarching philosophy at Rare View, Brad. In terms of where we fit in, I believe the asset management industry can be grouped into three\nThe first one is disrupting the existing distribution framework\nor the electronification of investing.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"The idea of investing by a style box or exposure to a region or an asset class\nin our experience does not deliver the real world outcomes that investors seek.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"So if we've got 10 or 11 sectors across fixed income,\nwe will identify in our model what we think is fundamentally the cheapest one.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Their unique systematic approach to investing provides investors an alternative lens on how to navigate investment markets.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in quantitative investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in income investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Neil Azous highlights important considerations around fixed income.

Donoghue Forlines is a adaptive investment firm that has specialized in risk-managed portfolios since 1986. Donoghue Forlines has a suite of ETFs that utilize technical indicators to recognize shifts in market momentum and uses proprietary adaptive signals to help preserve capital in down trending markets and potentially offer strong client-centric risk-adjusted returns over a full market cycle.

You can learn more about the firm and the Funds at donoghueforlines.com</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and John Forlines covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>John Forelines from Donnie Hugh Forelines. They have a really unique and diversified business. They do have a model portfolio business. They have an ETF business, and they also have a mutual fund business. John is a finance veteran. Started at some of the larger institutions until he started his 4A into entrepreneurship\nand running his own firms. So today we are going to talk specifically about their enhanced real asset ETF, which\nis Ticker DFRA. They also have a high yield ETF and a risk-managed innovation ETF that we touch on.</p>\n<p>That's the way it is. Now, in terms of just the actual\ndoing it, it's an allocation process where we have a lot to choose from, right? And you have percentages\nyou can choose from. And, and that's important, too. So if you, if you decide, you so, for example,\nyou may want to switch to an ETF in the portfolio that's in cash or treasuries,\nbecause you want to raise cash, that's how you do it as opposed to we're going to sell something.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So for example,\nit's often used in retirement portfolios where it does kick off that high yield. And yet,\nit doesn't have, it doesn't typically track what else is in there, which includes their\ntypical smattering of stock and bond holdings. So as far as communicating with a\nadvisor in a model portfolio, what ETF are holding in there would you most likely try to get them\nto replace or peel from to add DFRA? I think the main replacement\nis your typical commodity ETF.</p>\n<p>And then the next job, of course, I had was to run with another Morgan partner technology\nmedian telecom. And so that's where I've had my technology event, which is of course one or other ETS innovation. And so after that, in 2000, I was able to get out at the market peak, it was just a good\ntime. I mean, I think more anything else. And I helped Morgan liquidate a couple of their investments that we've made as part\nof the tech process and therefore I got my stock and equity and all that stuff out,\nwhich is good.</p>\n<p>That's the way to describe it. So, for example, if they had a dividend strategy that\ndividend strategy, they fully invested until certain market signals materialized, and then they\nwould switch to some type of treasuries. For a period of time, excuse me, and we brought, as I was\nengineered portfolios over, and it was pretty good mix, because all of a sudden, we had a different\nmix of broker dealers that we were serving, they were serving a different kind of broker dealer.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"They were trying to get out of it because of the real estate crash high interest rates I mentioned.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"And, you know, the bottom line is that stuff runs pretty well.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>John speaks mostly about their Yield Enhanced Real Asset ETF (DFRA) which provides exposure to real assets such as REITs, Infrastructure, Oil & Gas, Commodities, and Natural Resources.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in quantitative investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in income investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with John Forlines highlights important considerations around fixed income.

You better to blend the two, right? But do it waiting wise properly. So much more than five, 10% range got satellite of the core satellite approach. JoJo,\nI actually think of the three funds becomes the most interesting because at least it's got\nyield and income because it's a bond strategy.</p>\n<p>Today we have Michael Geid, he is a CEO and founder of ATAC Funds. He's a portfolio manager of two ETFs, Roro and Jojo, which is risk on risk off and junk\non junk off. He also has a mutual fund, but a lot of you might have some familiarity with Michael from\nall of his work that he does on social media, whether it be podcasts, videos, articles,\ndoes a lot of market commentary, and he's really out there active in the community providing\ninformation.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So, the new fund was up\n27% in 2017. And then 2020, yet the COVID crash, it's in treasuries, it ends 2020, up 72%. Aside from that, it's just an English, right? And it does go back to this point that every\nstrategy is a function of the cycle that you operate in. I need a very particular environment for\nreally old my funds. I need an environment where there's some left tail risk to have a chance\nof getting risk off right.</p>\n<p>Like, I believe in my approach,\nI know the research, I know the cycle dynamics. I know that I happen to launch. It's not\nintroduced in a show all the data of how unusual the last decade has been because of really\nQE3 breaking a lot of intermarker ratios. Does that mean that I should give up after 10 years\non Mutualner? Does that mean I should give up on Roro after just went through a historic collapse\nin the risk off life safety trade or if I could do it all over again, what I would I today\nlaunch the funds now.</p>\n<p>Now if I'm right, they have a credit event. Flight-to-safety research\nrecession happens and suddenly there's convexity in the performance hopefully of all of my funds. And this becomes then the real big challenge, which is that suddenly people start chasing the performance\nof the funds, what they should be buying it now in advance of that.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"They might like you and believe in you, but you're approaching me and I'll be working, because\nyou have to be in a cycle that doesn't favor your approach, right, and this is where I think\na lot of people get tripped up.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"But let's pivot, because I want to get into your funds, that's why you're here.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We also talk about the unique investment thesis behind his ETFs and how he envisions them being utilized in model portfolios.</li>\n<li>Michael has a unique perspective on markets and is one the most consistent providers of market commentary for investors and investment advisors online.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in international markets relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Michael Gayed highlights important considerations around fixed income.

In this episode, our special guest is Mike Venuto, the portfolio manager of $BLOK and co-founder and CIO at Tidal. $BLOK holds the distinction of being the first-ever blockchain ETF to hit the market. Join us as we delve into the evolving landscape of ETFs, exploring the rise of active ETFs, the conversion of mutual funds to ETFs, and the transformative impact of blockchain on the industry. With Mike's extensive experience in bringing ETFs to market and facilitating their growth, we gain valuable insights into common mistakes and pitfalls that early issuers often encounter. Our discussion covers crucial topics such as product-market fit, market timing, and how to navigate these challenges successfully. To explore Tidal's comprehensive range of ETFs and services, please visit their website at https://www.tidalfinancialgroup.com/</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Michael Venuto covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>We're souped and not\ndoing 90% of everything. We have this great slide where it shows how complicated the industry is\nand then we show a picture of the client and the investor and we connect them and put it all the\nbit. So those are clients like so-fi. We have 80 ETFs with them. Shorea funds which is our\nindie hit. This is a group in Canada that's got three ETFs in over 500 million across them. Nobody's ever heard of them.</p>\n<p>So, look, it's very, very simple that it's just a better rapper, right? Wice coffee's on my team calls it structure matters. The ETF structure is just in terms of\ncomparing it to LPs, SMAs, mutual funds. It's a better rapper, right? You've got more tax efficiency. And there's very little guarantees in the world of finance, but for a taxable investor,\nI can guarantee the exact same strategy in an ETF versus an SMA or mutual fund. It's got to be\nbetter in an ETF.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>What we learn, talking to management is more about the supply chain and\nthe other companies than we do about those companies themselves. We have exposure to crypto itself. So we own some of the Canadian spot Bitcoin ETFs in block and we have not only do we own micro strategies,\nwe also own his bonds. That's another thing block can do that. No one else has done we own bonds. So you know, we bought micro strategy bonds the last time crypto collapsed and it was just like,\nokay, this is better in the cap structure.</p>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF.

We will learn the inner workings of their strategies and what drives them as they continue\nto grow their company. Many of these individuals are entrepreneurs, and will have unique and compelling insights\nto share as much goes on behind the Ticker.</p>\n<p>I mean, we started this business, our current businesses, we were going to run private\nfunds and I went to SMA research and now all of a sudden we're in the ETF business. So I mean, I didn't think we'd get there, but it's just the path that you take. So before we talk about title, because I have a lot of questions about title. Personally, I always like to ask, what do you like to do when you're not working?</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"So like,\nthat's why they don't mind being second or third to market on things.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"So if you get product right,\nthe next thing is the biggest mistake I see with entrepreneurs in this is they get lost talking\nto each other and to their buddies and to the market makers and to this net.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>$BLOK holds the distinction of being the first-ever blockchain ETF to hit the market.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in fixed income relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in crypto & digital assets relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Michael Venuto highlights important considerations around crypto & digital assets.

So, what, as opposed to having one launch of 10 percent options,\nwe break that up in the two separate call transactions. So, there's a 5 percent allocation\nto June of any particular year and a 5 percent allocation to December. And the strategy works\nlike the clock, on the option component, where when June comes up, like we just had the June rebalance,\nwe sell that June of the current year date and then we roll it to the June of the following year date.</p>\n<p>Yeah, so I mean, the way that I see sworn is most advantageous is in very, very good\npositive environments, meaning if the markets up 50 percent, those call options are going to\nsing beautifully in the up a tremendous amount. And you have to remember the more the market goes\nup, the larger that proportion to portfolio becomes, the call option, until rebalance.

HNDL is a income producing strategy that seeks to provide a target distribution rate to its investors on an annualized basis. For more information on David and the HANDLS Indexes go to handlsindexes.com</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and David Cohen covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>It outperforms any dividend strategy\nyou can come up with. High dividend yield, dividend growth, you name it. And so, we launched a fund. Now, we've launched four soon to be five funds by the time this podcast comes out on this Shareholder\nYield concept. And it's one thing to do a back test in the public academic literature. It's\nanother thing to do it with real money. And we're happy with the performance of all these funds. We have a foreign fund and emerging market fund.</p>\n<p>So maybe they'll replace 10 or 20% of their stock\nallocation with this fund. There's people that are a lot more focused on style boxes so they do large\ncap growth, large cap value, mid-trap growth, mid-cap value in which case they'll use this fund\nas the mid-cap value category. We have a small cap version of this, which is M-Y-L-D, L-Y-L-D is our\nlarge cap version and then we have foreign emerging where we're trying to get people as many choices\nthey want, investors were coming to really appreciate, love this specific exposure.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>Today we have on Med Faber. He is the CEO of Cambria Investments. They have a large suite of ETFs, but we are specifically focusing on their shareholder\nyield suite today. And more importantly, we are looking at their largest fund in that shareholder yield category\nS.Y.L.D. We talk about what shareholder yield is, why it is important. Talk about the makeup of this fund. Talk about how it is performed significantly better than almost all dividend yield ETFs out there\non the market.</p>\n<p>It caps the sectors at a third. We don't want\nto be all in on energy or tech or something like that. And then it updates once a quarter. So it has somewhere in between like a traditional index and an active management turnover\nbut in the ETF structure, it tends to be quite tax-efficient and at its core. It's a basic\nlong-only type of strategy that the positions are around 1%. And if they go up too much,\nwe'll trim them and if they go down too much, we'll add to them.</p>\n<p>So we start with the whole universe. And the first step is what the academics would\ncall net payout yields. Everyone calls it shareholder yield, the vernacular. There's always\nso much jargon in our world but it's basically cash dividend and net stock buybacks. So that\neliminates 75% of the companies. I think it would be a surprise to most investors\nwhere if you look at the average company in the stock market as a net stock issuer. So\nthey're issuing shares in a given year.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"And so, the challenge with that is you can get your healthy serial that even exists,\nbut you can also get your fruit loops and frosted flakes and everything else.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"Now, the difference comes when a\nbuyback is executed if the stock is trading below and transit value.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>David is an industry veteran and has been responsible for the creation of many unique indexes throughout his career.</li>\n<li>HNDL is a income producing strategy that seeks to provide a target distribution rate to its investors on an annualized basis.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in etf structure relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with David Cohen highlights important considerations around international markets.

He also talks about Roundhill\u2019s approach to launching products, how they go about marketing, and what\u2019s coming next from the firm. More on Roundhill Investments and the CHAT ETF is available at www.roundhillinvestments.com</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Dave Mazza covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>So primarily the coming soon funds are related to\nour big ETFs. So what's great about that strategy is you can apply it to a variety of sectors\nand industries. For many years, you know, we've heard from investors today, hey, I'd love some\nprecision in home builders who I'd love some precision in airlines or defense that not that they\ncan't get that exposure, but they don't want anything else. They just want the big cats or the\nreal-pure place there.</p>\n<p>Right, if you look at some existing sector and industry ETFs,\nit's really watered down exposure. That certainly has paid off from a performance standpoint\nby focusing just on the larger banks. But really the theory there is giving people precision. The same can be said about big T, which is our big technology ETF. And that is just focused really\non the family stocks. And again, the idea there is not about trying to be niche or that. It's about\ngiving that precision exposure.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So we have a few core channels that we market through. And social media is a great one for us. Whether that's Twitter or LinkedIn or other channels that we're looking at,\nand also just being in the press through traditional media as well. I think the opportunity to\nspread your wings, the opportunity to get your message out there as wide as possible,\nis paramount. The ETF market is great because there's so much choice now for whether you're\na retail investor, financial advisor, in any way, shape or form, or a true institution.</p>\n<p>And we give\nthat a score. So the more, the more it's mentioned, the higher it is relatively simple. Now,\nthat's not just it, right, because what we don't want is just companies who are loading up and we\nsaw this with blockchain, right, who are changing their name, right, or just throwing an AI and\nthey have nothing to do with it. So the real research comes with what we call this sector score. And that's where we are identifying and looking at companies more from a fundamental basis,\ntraditional fundamentals, I should say, this is a quantitative approach.</p>\n<p>And we know through the research, the quantitative\nresearch that we do, looking at fundamentals, their revenue is actually coming and they said it on\ntheir call and so much is going to come from chipset power generative AI. So low in behold,\nit has a high rank on the transcript score, high rank on the sector score, high rank in the\nportfolio.</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"So it is brand new, we are going to learn all about how it works and how it operates,\nand I think you are going to get not only an education in the difference between AI and\ngenerative AI, but also some of the companies they are looking at and how they are building this\nindex.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"I think the opportunity to\nspread your wings, the opportunity to get your message out there as wide as possible,\nis paramount.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in energy relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in energy relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in energy relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Dave Mazza highlights important considerations around energy.

Garrett built his company to support ETF providers and issuers, providing listeners with a look at what it takes to start and run an ETF. His passion is flying but the conversation is grounded in the realities and challenges faced in launching a family of ETFs. These challenges became his catalyst to become a white label ETF issuer, offering infrastructure and exemptive relief to other market participants. ETC now helps clients launch funds in as little as 100 days, significantly reducing costs and time-to-market. Stevens emphasizes the importance of having a solid plan, patience, and an effective distribution strategy to succeed in the ETF business. To learn more about ETC, please visit https://www.exchangetradedconcepts.com/</p>\n<h2>Deeper Dive: Insights from the Full Conversation</h2>\n<p>Beyond the headline strategy, the full conversation between Brad and Garrett Stevens covered several additional themes worth highlighting for advisors and investors.</p>\n<h3>On Process and Philosophy</h3>\n<p>And which is great,\nbut there are a lot of active strategies as you said that are indexed passive. So, what are the\nadvantages of having that index be passive? Well, it can be a couple of things. One is from a\nmarketing standpoint, right indexes, at least currently are not regulated. And so, you can talk about\nthe index in different ways that you can talk about the fund. And so, we may have clients who come\nto us to launch who are not a registered investment advisor currently and by launching an index,\nthey don't have to register with the SEC.</p>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF. Behind the Ticker, uncovers the inner workings of the ETF industry. We will interview portfolio managers and ETF service providers to dive deep into their\nwork lives and their businesses. We will learn the inner workings of their strategies and what drives them as they continue\nto grow their company. Many of these individuals are entrepreneurs, and will have unique and compelling insights\nto share as much goes on behind the Ticker.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>So you run Exchange Traded Concepts. We have mostly had on other ETF managers up to this point, so this will be a very interesting\nconversation. I think it will be for portfolio managers out there that are maybe thinking about getting\nin the space, and I think there can be some value for existing managers to learn from some\nof your expertise. But before we get into it, tell me about your professional background and how you decided\nto launch Exchange Traded Concepts.</p>\n<p>So, we have four full-time portfolio managers at our firm now\nat handle all of the, the teamwork and the trading functions for clients. We brought marketing\nservices in-house over the years. All of the legal and compliance. We brought in-house to\nhave a full legal and compliance team now in our offices, accounting and finance. We brought in-house\nas well. But, we still utilize outsize out-time firms. We, we actually are the only white-labeled\nETF issue where that has multiple firms.</p>\n<p>That was one of the main\nreason we launched. So it's interesting to hear you say that. Of course we want to we do care\nof other people by it.

Brad and Daniel take a look at the systematic approach taken by PMV Capital, highlighting the importance of macroeconomic factors in portfolio allocation and risk management. PMV recognized the need for an ETF structure to compete effectively and launched the ARP ETF in December.

So I think a lot of people's early experiences determined\ntheir outlook on investing and how they think about things and that's certainly true for me. So I've always been concerned with figuring out how we manage this market risk systematic risk\nand my approach to that has been through asset allocation and mixing in stocks, bonds,\ncommodities in a way that really manages that risk.</p>\n<p>Well I think the average investor learned that last year right\nyou had both fixed income and equities you got the full brunt of the downside and the lack of\nthe diversification benefits of that portfolio last year right. So what\nprimary factors help drive better risk adjusted return in your model right so\nit's let me ask that a different way I should say and what environments you should always\nown risk parity in my opinion right I think it always deserves a spotting report for you but when\nare you going to produce the most alpha in this portfolio is that in recessionary environments\nor and market wall and when I speak when I say market wall equity wall.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF.

He is the founder of PMV Capital as well as the portfolio manager of the ARP ETF, which stands\nfor adaptive risk parity. If you don't know what risk parity is, today you're going to get a lesson on it. If you don't have it in your portfolio, you're going to get reasons why you absolutely\nshould. I think Daniel and his team do a wonderful job with their systematic approach. They take towards risk parity.</p>\n<p>We have some separate accounts that we manage. But our primary focus is really on the ETF and but we do we have a series of risk-based\nallocation models that are in this risk-perity style and we'll use our ETF as active component\nand then we'll mix in other static positions to kind of get people to where they need to be. But we do we have a series of those SMA portfolios.</p>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in fixed income relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in portfolio construction relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in market outlook relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Daniel Snover highlights important considerations around fixed income.

So the WCO ETF is supposed to fit in that small cap allocation. So we took our benchmark, which is the FTWILser small cap index, because we correlate\nto small cap index. And we matched their industry weightings. And therefore, when we did the, so for example, if the FTWILser small cap index has 6%\nof energy, our fund will also have 6% of energy.</p>\n<p>We wanted to focus on what we know, which is isolating the female factor. And second of all, getting the world to understand what the female factor is and why it outperforms. And because today, the only place where you are, you have more money right now,\ngoing into early stage female focused funds, then you have money going into gender lens products. And that is upside down, right, because in, in your portfolio allocation,\nyour publics should, your public investments should be a much larger piece of your portfolio.</p>\n<h3>Market Context and Positioning</h3>\n<p>I'm Brad Roth, Chief Investment Officer of Thor Financial Technologies, and portfolio manager\nof THLV, the Thor Low Volatility ETF.

Many of these individuals are entrepreneurs and will have unique and compelling insights\nto share as much goes on behind the Ticker.</p>\n<p>But we don't have 6% female CEOs in the energy sector. So we have to overweight them. So we made it industry-neutral vis-a-vis its benchmark and that gives us our weightings. So how often are you running a new screen and how often are you rebalancing the index?</p>\n<p>So we're permanently looking at what's going on in our portfolio, because we have the discretion\nto, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to the, from, we don't have, we're not benchmarked to the\nWCO index. The WCO index is calculated after the ETF decides what it's due, right? So, so because of that, we're constantly monitoring what's going on, but we rebalancing\nevery month. So every month, we, so, so anytime a company no longer has a female CEO or, on the reverse,\nif a company, a, a points of female CEO, we will buy or sell that stock that same month.</p>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in portfolio construction relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in energy relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in portfolio construction relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Patricia Lizarraga highlights important considerations around portfolio construction.

On the other side, right? Pharmaceuticals did great\nlast year. So, again, we're kind of a blend of a lot of ETFs combined, where take out the\nguesswork to some extent. You want to be in these industries. We're going to give you hopefully a\nlittle bit better of a risk adjusted return at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>So I guess we'll start from the beginning, which was in college. I started working at a mutual fund shop out in San Diego, and then progressed and got\non my securities license, started working at a Merrill Lynch on the wealth management side, realized\nthe wire house world was maybe not necessarily for me. So I joined a firm, private capital investment advisors in about 2016. And, you know, me, I've got, I'm a little bit younger for to be an advisor in that world.</p>\n<p>So, you touched on it a little bit. Let's dive a little bit\ndeeper into the investment strategy at bad. Get it from a high level. So, how are you screening? How are you running kind of the portfolio in terms of waiting? Let's talk about the\nbalance structure. Like, let's really dive into the underlying strategy.</p>\n<p>Makes a ton of sense. Makes a ton of sense. And so, when you were designing this index,\nit sounds like it from the beginning of our conversation. It sounded to me as if you had the idea for\nthe ETF before you actually ran the index. And so, when you ran the index, you were trying to build,\ncan we call it anti-ESG?</p>\n<h2>Notable Insights</h2>\n<blockquote><p>\"So, big concert guy, big, big sports\nguy, you know, hometowns Kansas City was, had the, had the opportunity to go to the Super Bowl,\nso I'm sorry to anyone from Philly on that one.\"</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\"But yeah, you know, I like to, I kind of have a\nwork hard and you know, honestly play hard to mentality at the end of the day, but obviously,\nthere's a fine line of professionalism in, you know, being too much of a screwball by the name.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in growth investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in esg & thematic relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n<li>The conversation explores important themes in quantitative investing relevant to today's advisor landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What This Means for Advisors</h2>\n<p>For financial advisors evaluating options for client portfolios, this conversation with Tommy Mancuso highlights important considerations around growth investing.
