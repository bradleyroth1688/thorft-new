## Company Overview

THOR Financial Technologies, LLC is a registered investment adviser headquartered at 327 W Pittsburgh St, Greensburg, PA 15601. The firm was founded by Brad Roth and specializes in technology-driven, systematic investment solutions for registered investment advisors (RIAs).

THOR's core innovation is the application of proprietary signal processing technology — adapted from telecommunications and defense industries — to financial markets. This technology detects market regime changes in real time, allowing portfolios to adapt their positioning before major risk events unfold. The result is a suite of model portfolios and ETFs that systematically manage risk without relying on human emotion or discretionary judgment.

### Mission
To eliminate the behavioral biases that destroy investor wealth by replacing emotional decision-making with systematic, data-driven investment processes.

### Key Differentiators
1. **Proprietary Signal Processing** — Built in-house, not licensed. Detects regime changes traditional indicators miss.
2. **100% Cash Capability** — All models can move entirely to short-duration treasuries when systemic risk is elevated.
3. **Risk-First Philosophy** — Capital preservation is the foundation; every strategy manages downside risk first.
4. **Behavioral Bias Elimination** — Systematic rules replace gut feelings and emotional reactions.
5. **Cascading De-Risk Architecture** — Risk is managed progressively, not as a binary on/off switch.

### AUM and Scale
- $1.1B+ in combined assets under management across ETFs and model portfolios
- 6 distinct model portfolios
- 2 actively managed ETFs
- 94+ podcast episodes
- Featured on ETF.com, Schwab Network, InvestmentNews, Yahoo Finance, FinTech TV, NYSE

## Model Portfolios (Detailed)

All model portfolio performance is hypothetical, back-tested, and net of a 0.20% management fee. Past performance is not indicative of future results. See thorft.com/disclosures/ for complete hypothetical performance disclaimers.

### 1. Sector 100
- **Category:** Domestic Equity
- **URL:** https://thorft.com/models/sector-100/
- **Strategy:** Trades S&P 500 sector ETFs, equally weighted across each sector. THOR's proprietary technology evaluates each sector independently for risk-on/risk-off conditions. Risk-off sectors rotate to short-duration treasuries while the best-performing sectors receive overweight allocation. When a majority of sectors signal risk-off, the portfolio can move to 100% short-duration treasuries.
- **Allocation:** 100/0 Equity/Fixed Income
- **Benchmark:** S&P 500
- **Minimum Investment:** $25,000
- **Corresponding ETF:** THLV (Thor Equal Weight Low Volatility ETF), tracking the Thor Low Volatility Index
- **Inception:** ~2009
- **Factsheet:** https://thorft.com/documents/thor-sector-100-factsheet.pdf

### 2. Low Volatility SDQ
- **Category:** Domestic Equity
- **URL:** https://thorft.com/models/low-volatility-sdq/
- **Strategy:** Trades the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq 100 with an equally weighted 33/33/33 allocation. Proprietary signals evaluate each index independently and dynamically rotate toward the best-performing index. Cascading risk-off: one index off = remaining two split 50/50; two indices off = 50% remaining / 50% cash; three off = 100% short-duration treasuries.
- **Allocation:** 100/0 Equity/Fixed Income
- **Benchmark:** S&P 500
- **Minimum Investment:** $5,000
- **Corresponding ETF:** THIR (Thor SDQ Index Rotation ETF), tracking the Thor SDQ Rotation Index
- **Factsheet:** https://thorft.com/documents/thor-low-volatility-sdq-factsheet.pdf

### 3. International
- **Category:** International Equity
- **URL:** https://thorft.com/models/international/
- **Strategy:** Trades country-specific equity ETFs representing the top 10 countries by market capitalization and economic output (Japan, UK, Germany, France, South Korea, Italy, and others). Equally weighted with the same cascading de-risk approach — individual country positions rotate to short-duration treasuries when risk-off. Can move to 100% cash during global risk events.
- **Allocation:** 100/0 Equity/Fixed Income
- **Benchmark:** Total World Stock
- **Minimum Investment:** $5,000
- **Factsheet:** https://thorft.com/documents/thor-international-factsheet.pdf

### 4. Levered Index
- **Category:** Enhanced Domestic Equity
- **URL:** https://thorft.com/models/levered-index/
- **Strategy:** Uses a dual-signal framework (standard THOR signal + fast-response signal) across three states. Both risk-on = up to ~140% S&P 500 exposure via index + leveraged ETFs. Standard on / fast off = 60% index + 40% buffer ETF. Both off = 100% buffer ETF providing downside protection with upside capture.
- **Allocation:** Up to 140% Equity Exposure
- **Benchmark:** S&P 500
- **Minimum Investment:** $5,000
- **Factsheet:** https://thorft.com/documents/thor-levered-index-factsheet.pdf

### 5. NextGen Stock
- **Category:** Growth Equity
- **URL:** https://thorft.com/models/nextgen-stock/
- **Strategy:** Concentrated portfolio of 8–12 high-growth, disruptive stocks. Same proprietary cascading de-risk approach — positions ladder down from full equity to 100% short-duration treasuries as risk signals escalate. Designed as a higher-octane satellite strategy to complement core holdings.
- **Allocation:** 100/0 Equity/Fixed Income
- **Benchmark:** Growth Innovation
- **Minimum Investment:** $50,000
- **Factsheet:** https://thorft.com/documents/thor-nextgen-stock-factsheet.pdf

### 6. Dollar ALT
- **Category:** Alternatives
- **URL:** https://thorft.com/models/dollar-alt/
- **Strategy:** Precious metals allocation with 60% gold ETF / 40% silver ETF when risk-on. Each metal is evaluated independently — if either signals risk-off, that position rotates to short-term treasuries. Both off = 100% cash. Provides dollar diversification and non-correlated alternative exposure.
- **Allocation:** 60/40 Gold/Silver
- **Benchmark:** Precious Metals Basket
- **Minimum Investment:** $5,000
- **Factsheet:** https://thorft.com/documents/thor-dollar-alt-factsheet.pdf

## The Book

**"Little Reasons, Big Consequences: Why Your Investment Returns Stink"**
By Brad Roth

A 12-chapter, ~10,600-word exploration of the behavioral mistakes that destroy investor wealth. The core thesis: investors underperform due to behavior, not bad strategies. The book makes the case that systematic, rules-based investing consistently outperforms emotionally-driven approaches.

Key themes:
- The performance gap between fund returns and investor returns
- Why fear and greed drive destructive investment cycles
- The limitations of buy-and-hold during market crises
- How information overload leads to worse decisions
- Why systematic rules beat human intuition
- Signal processing principles applied to investing
- The risk-first approach to portfolio management
