## What THOR Does

THOR builds systematic investment strategies that use proprietary signal processing — techniques adapted from telecommunications and defense — to detect market regime changes in real time. When conditions shift from risk-on to risk-off, THOR's models adapt automatically, cascading positions into short-duration treasuries. All strategies can move to 100% cash during periods of elevated systemic risk. The goal is to eliminate behavioral biases and replace emotional decision-making with disciplined, data-driven execution.
