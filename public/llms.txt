# THOR Financial Technologies

> THOR Financial Technologies is a registered investment adviser based in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. The firm provides technology-driven, systematic model portfolios and actively managed ETFs for registered investment advisors (RIAs). Founded by Brad Roth, THOR uses proprietary signal processing technology to manage risk across all of its investment strategies.

## What THOR Does

THOR builds systematic investment strategies that use proprietary signal processing — techniques adapted from telecommunications and defense — to detect market regime changes in real time. When conditions shift from risk-on to risk-off, THOR's models adapt automatically, cascading positions into short-duration treasuries. All strategies can move to 100% cash during periods of elevated systemic risk. The goal is to eliminate behavioral biases and replace emotional decision-making with disciplined, data-driven execution.
